Heartaid is more expensive than the currently used medication. The analysis will include a significance test with H0: Heartaid and the current medication are equally effective at preventing heart disease and HA: Heartaid is more effective than the current medication at preventing heart disease. Which of these would be a potential consequence of a Type II error? Choices: I. Doctors will begin to prescribe Heartaid to patients, even though it is actually not any more effective than the current medication. or II. Patients will continue to use the current medication, even though Heartaid is actually more effective. or III.
