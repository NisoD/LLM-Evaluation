He said \"Man, give it five minutes.\" I asked him what he meant by that? He said, it's fine to disagree, it's fine to push back, it's great to have strong opinions and beliefs, but give my ideas some time to set in before you're sure you want to argue against them. \"Five minutes\" represented \"think\", not react. He was totally right. I came into the discussion looking to prove something, not learn something.\nThis was a big moment for me.\nRichard has spent his career thinking about these problems.

The tall structure is usually a fixed object, such as a building, bridge or crane; but it is also possible to jump from a movable object, such as a hot-air balloon or helicopter, that has the ability to stay over one place on the ground; fixed-wing aircraft are unsuitable because they only stay high when moving quickly forward.\nWhen the person jumps, the cord stretches to absorb  the energy of the fall, then the jumper flies upwards again as the cord jumps back. The jumper oscillates up and down until all the energy is used up.\nThe word bungee first appeared around 1930 and was the name for a rubber eraser.

The tall structure is usually a fixed object, such as a building, bridge or crane; but it is also possible to jump from a movable object, such as a hot-air balloon or helicopter, that has the ability to stay over one place on the ground; fixed-wing aircraft are unsuitable because they only stay high when moving quickly forward.\nWhen the person jumps, the cord stretches to absorb  the energy of the fall, then the jumper flies upwards again as the cord jumps back. The jumper oscillates up and down until all the energy is used up.\nThe word bungee first appeared around 1930 and was the name for a rubber eraser.

According to the modern legend, he is a magical figure who visits all the children of the world during the night before Christmas Day, leaving presents which they find the next morning. He flies through the night sky in a sledge pulled by reindeer, and enters houses by climbing down chimneys. This strange legend is based on the life of a man called Nicholas, but in fact we know very little about him. Historians think he was a Christian bishop in Turkey in about 285--350 A.D. One of the stories about him is that he helped three poor girls. No one would marry them because they were so poor. To provide them with money for their weddings, Nicholas secretly dropped some gold coins down the chimney of their house. After Nicholas died, he was made a saint  by the church.(The name Santa Claus thus comes from St Nicholas.) His feast day was celebrated in December, and parents started giving their children secret presents from St Nicholas. Over the years, this custom became part of our Christmas traditions.\nRecently, a psychologist has claimed that Father Christmas is \"the perfect fantasy\" for children. According to Professor Anthony Clare, children love the character of Father Christmas because he is like an ideal father: he loves children and gives them presents, but he never criticizes them, is never angry, and children do not even need to thank him for the presents. Other writers, however, point out that Father Christmas can be a frightening character to some children. Jane Bidder says that some children are terrified of this fat, bearded old man. It can certainly confuse many children. As parents, we warn our children to be careful of strangers and never to let them into the house, and yet we tell children that a strange man will come into their bedroom at night!

It's not the one I gave, because the situation was not right. As a lawyer in the entertainment industry, I knew the audience wanted to hear some amusing stories about my work with well-known people, but here's the true answer:\nThe most important thing I've ever done occurred on October 8,1990. I began the day playing tennis with an old friend I hadn't seen for a while. Between points we talked about what had been happening in each other's lives. He and his wife had just had a baby boy, who was keeping them up at night.\nWhile we were playing, a car came screaming up the road toward the courts. It was my friend's father, who shouted to my friend that his baby had stopped breathing and was being rushed to the hospital. In a flash my friend was in the car and gone, disappearing in a cloud of dust.\nFor a moment I just stood there, paralyzed . Then I tried to figure out what I should do. Follow my friend to the hospital? There was nothing I could accomplish there, I convinced myself. My friend's son was in the care of doctors and nurses, and nothing I could do or say would affect the outcome. Be there for moral support? Well, maybe. But my friend and his wife both had large families, and I knew they'd be surrounded by relatives who would provide more than enough comfort and support, whatever happened. All I could do at the hospital, I decided, was to get in the way. Also, I had planned a full day with my family, who were waiting for me to get home. So I decided to head back to my house and check in my friend later.\nAs I started my car, I realized that my friend had left his truck and keys at the courts. I now faced another problem. I couldn't leave the keys in the truck. So I decided to go to the hospital and give him the keys.\nWhen I arrived, I was directed to a room where my friend and his wife were waiting. As I had thought, the room was filled with family members silently watching my friend comfort his wife. I went in and stood by the door, trying to decide what to do next. Soon a doctor appeared. He approached my friend and his wife, and in a quiet voice told them that their son had died.\nFor a long time the two held each other and cried, unaware of the rest of us standing around in pained silence. After they had calmed themselves, the doctor suggested they spend a few moments with their son.\nMy friend and his wife stood up and walked past their families. When they reached the door, my friend saw me standing in the corner. He came over and hugged me and started to cry. My friend's wife hugged me, too, and said , \"Thanks for being here.\"\nFor the rest of that morning, I sat in the emergency room of that hospital and watched my friend and his wife hold the body of their infant son, and say goodbye.\nIt's the most important thing I have ever done. The experience taught me two lessons.\nFirst: The most important thing I've ever done happened when I was completely helpless. None of the things I had learned in university, in three years of law school or in six years of legal practice were of any use in that situation. Something terrible was happening to people I cared about, and I was powerless to change the outcome. All I could do was standing by and watching it happen. And yet it was critical that I do just that--- just be there when someone needed me.\nSecond: The most important thing I've done almost didn't happen because of things I had learned in classroom and professional life. Law school taught me how to take a set of facts, break them down and organized them. These skills are critical for lawyers. When people come to us for help, they're often stressed out and depend on a lawyer to think logically. But while learning to think, I almost forget how to feel. Today I have no doubt that I should have leapt into my car without hesitation and followed my friend to the hospital.\nFrom that one experience I learned that the most important thing in life isn't the money you make, the status you attain or the honors you achieve.

Dr. Thomas Houston, a professor of the University of Massachusetts Medical School, led a group of scientists that investigated how pre-recorded videos of hypertension   patients' talking about their medical histories helped another group of patients with high blood pressure to control their condition over several months.\n   Houston was surprised by their studies that suggested that communication can be a powerful tool in medicine. They showed that those who had had similar experiences, when talking to someone with a similar background, could help change their behavior to become healthier. Hypertension is difficult to control, since it is dependent on diet, exercise and mental state. Medical treatments with drugs, and lifestyle therapies  have been  ly ineffective because people find it hard to follow those medical requirements.\n   In the test, his team carefully chose their story-tellers from 230 members of a patients' community with whom they could most easily relate. Next, they divided their study population into two groups. One received three interactive   DVDs containing the tellers' stories of their experiences in living with and treating their hypertension. The other were given educational discs on an unrelated health topic. The study volunteers reported that they had listened to the DVDs, and after three months, those who heard the stories of the hypertensive patients lowered their blood pressure.\n  While the study did not  _ how the story-telling influenced the patients' behavior, Houston suspects that watching patients of similar backgrounds who had a similar medical experience helped to motivate them to seek medical help to their hypertension.

It was a string of earthquakes that made the small town shake all the time.This went on for more than a year.Sometimes the quakes were very small.Only certain instruments could pick them up.At other times, the quakes damaged houses and land.The people were always afraid.They wished they knew how to stop the ground from shaking.\nPeople all over the world would like to know when an earthquake is coming.But an earthquake is almost always a surprise.Under the surface of the Earth, huge blocks of rock drift apart or slide against each other.The ground above splits apart or rumbles and shakes.\nSome scientists hope to predict quakes by keeping a close watch on animals.It seems that some animals can sense an earthquake coming.In 1969, animals in a Chinese zoo began to act funny one day.Swans flew out of their pond.A panda sat down, covered its eyes with its paws, and groaned.The animals seemed to know that something was about to happen.And it did.An earthquake struck.What was it that the animals sensed? Scientists are trying to find out.\nKeeping close track of the Earth's magnetic force in earthquake areas may also help.A few years ago, in Hollister, CA, scientists kept a record of the area's magnetic pull.For one week, the force grew stronger.Then it weakened suddenly.A day later, an earthquake struck.\nIt may become possible to know when and where an earthquake will happen.But it will be much harder to stop one from happening.\nMany scientists think that the Earth's covering is not smooth.They say the earth's \"skin\" is made up of huge puzzle pieces called plates.Land and ocean floors make up these huge plates.Under the Earth's crust  , or plates, is hot rock.The plates float on top of this rock.Sometimes the rock forces its way through the crust.What happens then? A volcano is born! More often, the rock moves and forces the plates to pull away from each other, causing earthquakes to happen.(Volcanoes and earthquakes often go together.)\nSometimes, the plates end up on top of each other.When this happens, the land above may look strange.Seen from the air, there seems to be a long scar in the Earth.This is called a fault  .The areas along faults have more earthquakes than other parts of the Earth.\nFor now, we'll just have to shake along with the Earth.It goes through millions of small earthquakes every year.With luck, you won't feel a thing!

It was a string of earthquakes that made the small town shake all the time.This went on for more than a year.Sometimes the quakes were very small.Only certain instruments could pick them up.At other times, the quakes damaged houses and land.The people were always afraid.They wished they knew how to stop the ground from shaking.\nPeople all over the world would like to know when an earthquake is coming.But an earthquake is almost always a surprise.Under the surface of the Earth, huge blocks of rock drift apart or slide against each other.The ground above splits apart or rumbles and shakes.\nSome scientists hope to predict quakes by keeping a close watch on animals.It seems that some animals can sense an earthquake coming.In 1969, animals in a Chinese zoo began to act funny one day.Swans flew out of their pond.A panda sat down, covered its eyes with its paws, and groaned.The animals seemed to know that something was about to happen.And it did.An earthquake struck.What was it that the animals sensed? Scientists are trying to find out.\nKeeping close track of the Earth's magnetic force in earthquake areas may also help.A few years ago, in Hollister, CA, scientists kept a record of the area's magnetic pull.For one week, the force grew stronger.Then it weakened suddenly.A day later, an earthquake struck.\nIt may become possible to know when and where an earthquake will happen.But it will be much harder to stop one from happening.\nMany scientists think that the Earth's covering is not smooth.They say the earth's \"skin\" is made up of huge puzzle pieces called plates.Land and ocean floors make up these huge plates.Under the Earth's crust  , or plates, is hot rock.The plates float on top of this rock.Sometimes the rock forces its way through the crust.What happens then? A volcano is born! More often, the rock moves and forces the plates to pull away from each other, causing earthquakes to happen.(Volcanoes and earthquakes often go together.)\nSometimes, the plates end up on top of each other.When this happens, the land above may look strange.Seen from the air, there seems to be a long scar in the Earth.This is called a fault  .The areas along faults have more earthquakes than other parts of the Earth.\nFor now, we'll just have to shake along with the Earth.It goes through millions of small earthquakes every year.With luck, you won't feel a thing! Question: How does a fault form? Choices: A. When California rests on two separate plates. B. When the plates end up on top of each other. C. Before an earthquake happens. D. After volcano comes.

She may not realize it, but she's more exposed to the world than she's ever likely to be again. And it isn't because she's a girl. It could be a boy. It could be you.\nBut why is she 'shelter less ? She s got a place to live in quite a pleasant place by the look of it and if shelter .\nDoesn't' t mean a house, then what does it mean? When we say someone \"lives a sheltered life\" , we don't only mean that their house is comfortable. We mean that they're protected from too many worries and troubles, that they live in a settled home, probably surrounded by friends and family, and that they don't have to cope with the difficulties the world is full of alone.\nCertainly no one would say that this girl was leading a sheltered life; she's leaving home to earn her living in a strange city and live by herself in a bed sitter. She may be just as well protected physically as a \"sheltered life\" person, but she's lost all the other shelters in her life--family, friends, the home she grew up in, school, the groups she belonged to. She s on her own now and unless she's very self-reliant , she's likely to feel unhappy and insecure at times.\nA young person setting out on her own like this is between the two main kinds of shelter most of us spend our lives in. One is our parents home where we grow up, and the other is the home we make ourselves and where we bring up our own children. For most people the time they spend between or outside these two shelters is only a small part of their lives. Question: What would be best title for the passage? Choices: A. Leaving Home B.

If those microorganisms could be identified, we could put them to work eating the plastic much faster than under normal conditions.\nWith this goal in mind, he ground plastic bags into a powder and concocted  a solution of household chemicals, yeast  and tap water to encourage microbes growth. Then he added the plastic powder and let the microbes work their magic for 3 months. Finally, he tested the resulting bacterial culture on plastic bags, exposing one plastic sample to dead bacteria as a control. Sure enough, the plastic exposed to the live bacteria was 17% lighter than the control after six weeks.\nThe inputs are cheap: maintaining the required temperature takes little energy because microbes produce heat as they work, and the only outputs are water and tiny levels of carbon dioxide.\n\"Almost every week I have to do chores and when I open the closet door, I have piles of plastic bags falling on top of me.

The first time little David came to our camp, he was hairless and worn out from medical treatments. He was also very angry.\nPaul Newman's camp counselors ( ) were hoping to fill David's days with fun and laughter. But David stayed inside himself, wanting to be alone, or in a corner of the cabin. At this camp for children with life-threatening illnesses, we had seen some pretty tough children worn out by cancer recover full of energy despite their illness. But we saw little progress in David no matter what we tried with him. Five days into the eight-day session saw a quiet, sad little pirate.\n Then something happened on that fifth night. Something at camp that we would call \"huge\". \nIt was cabin night. That's the time when campers and counselors spend lime together in each individual cabin instead of an all-camp activity. Campers love cabin nights because there's always a bedtime snack. On the cabin table that night were bags of potato chips.\nDavid slowly walked over to the table, leaving his comer to join the rest of us. He took one of the bags of the potato chips and started smashing  it with his little fists, as all the other campers looked on in disbelief, I wondered what the cabin counselor would do.\nThe college-age volunteer counselor positioned a bag of chips on die table in front of himself, and he, too, started smashing it with his fist. The campers went crazy as everyone ran to the table to get in on the fun of smashing potato chips with their fists.\nSomehow everyone knew, everyone sensed, that anger within him was now being released. \nFor the last couple days of the session, David was a different kid. He was a little nine-year-old boy again, trying to fill the hours of each remaining day at camp with as much fun as could be possible.\nSeveral days after the session, David came back again. This time, there wasn't anything he wouldn't try to fit in to his day. He sure was having a great time at camp. David asked me if I needed an altar boy when I celebrated Mass in the woods. Sure enough, he was my altar boy. I remembered how carefully he listened to me when I talked about death. 1 said it's only a doorway. You walk through the door and there's the Lord God and behind God a whole line of people waiting to hug you.\nAfter Mass, he said to me, \"Hey Fatha, a door, huh?\"\nA couple more days of fun passed and tonight was the talent show. The tradition is that campers and counselors dress up in costumes, and everyone gets a standing applause for singing and dancing or simply just acting like fools on stage.\n The show had begun: lights, camera, action.\nUnfortunately, the only action taking place in our row of seats was little David making his way from counselor to counselor to say an early good-bye to camp. He had become quite ill and had to go to the hospital because of this new crisis.\nWhen this little nine-year-old pirate stood in front of me, he gave me a hug and a big wet kiss on my cheek. 1 was crying. He was crying. A whole row of counselors was in tears.

One might find them playing unusual musical instruments, shopping at second-hand stores or expressing themselves in other unique ways. They call themselves hipsters. Being \"hip\" used to mean following the latest fashion. But gradually the word has evolved into a synonym for \"cool\".\nHipsters value independent thinking, progressive politics, an appreciation of creativity and intelligence. Hipsters take pains and pride in not being mainstream. However, their culture has become quite trendy. This irony is central to their culture and offers an interesting paradox.\n\"I do take things in the mainstream with a grain of salt,\" says Ben Polson, a college student at Brown University in the US. Polson describes himself as a hipster and says he often questions what determines popularity, especially regarding music.When lesser-known bands become popular they often lose their former fan base in exchange for a new one. There is a famous hipster saying that goes: I used to like that band before it got popular.\nAccording to Polson, bands' music changes when they go mainstream. They become \"less experimental, doing things just to save popularity and fans. The original elements that we were drawn to slowly _ for the sake of popularity.\"\nMany young adults have started to view hipsters' outlook as cool and are adopting their counterculture mindset  themselves. This has led to specialized brands, stores and music for the hipster position. Ironically, some such stores, including clothing labels Urban Outfitters and American Apparel, have gained mainstream popularity. This has seemingly diluted  the anti-mainstream culture.\n\"A lot of people that are self-defined hipsters aren't really hipsters, they're just trying to conform to the non-conformist  to seem cooler,\" says Amanda Leopold, a college student from Oberlin College, US. Although Leopold has many unconventional tastes and seems quite individualist, she refuses to classify herself as a hipster.\nThere is a conflict among hipsters about the very definition of the label. To some, to be a hipster is to be free from cultural constraints. To others, it means wearing a certain style and listening to a specific style of music. The former constantly strives for uniqueness, while the latter strives not to be mainstream.\nAnd yet, the movement is gaining mainstream popularity. \"It's kind of the trend these days; _ \" says Leopold. \"There have been hipsters since the seventies. It's only become popular recently.\"\nHipsters reject materialism and laugh at mainstream culture. But are they really beyond material comforts? Do they have any ideas of their own if they despise mainstream so much?\nChristy Wampole, an associate professor of literature at Princeton University, US, is not so sure. She says the hipster is a contradiction in himself and an easy target of mockery .

In the mid-2000s he famously coined the phrase \"mindless eating\"(and wrote a book by that name) to focus attention on all the bad dietary decisions we make without really thinking about them.\nHis new book, Slim by Design: Mindless Eating Solutions for Everyday Life, aims to change the design of restaurants, school lunchrooms, office cafeterias and homes so that the mindless choices we make will be more healthful ones. Some examples:\nKeep kitchen counters clear. No visible snack food, no bread, no nuts--not even breakfast cereal. In Wansink's research, \"women who had even one box of breakfast cereal that was visible-anywhere in their kitchen--weighed 21 pounds more than their neighbor who didn't.\"\nTrick yourself into drinking less wine. \"We tend to focus on the height of what we pour and not the width, so we pour 12 percent less wine into taller wineglasses than we pour into wider wineglasses.\" And the shape of the glass is not the only variable that affects how much we drink. Wansink writes: \"Because red wine is easier to see than white wine, we pour 9 percent less red wine whenever we pour a glass.\"\nWansink said his researchers also found that people ate less at restaurants when sat in well-lighted areas near windows and doors, than in darker areas or in the back. They ate less if they were offered a doggie bag, or to-go box, before they got their meals: apparently the idea of getting a \"free\" second meal outweighed the impulse  to clean their plates. Workers who frequently ate at their desks weighed 15.4 pounds less, on average, than those who didn't. Fruits and vegetables kept on the top shelf of the refrigerator were eaten at higher rates than those on lower shelves.\nThe point, Wansink says, is to consider findings like those and change your environment or habits. Then you won't have to think about it: You'll just eat less. Question: Why did Brian Wansink write Slim by Design: Mindless eating Solutions for Everyday Life? Choices: A.

In the mid-2000s he famously coined the phrase \"mindless eating\"(and wrote a book by that name) to focus attention on all the bad dietary decisions we make without really thinking about them.\nHis new book, Slim by Design: Mindless Eating Solutions for Everyday Life, aims to change the design of restaurants, school lunchrooms, office cafeterias and homes so that the mindless choices we make will be more healthful ones. Some examples:\nKeep kitchen counters clear. No visible snack food, no bread, no nuts--not even breakfast cereal. In Wansink's research, \"women who had even one box of breakfast cereal that was visible-anywhere in their kitchen--weighed 21 pounds more than their neighbor who didn't.\"\nTrick yourself into drinking less wine. \"We tend to focus on the height of what we pour and not the width, so we pour 12 percent less wine into taller wineglasses than we pour into wider wineglasses.\" And the shape of the glass is not the only variable that affects how much we drink. Wansink writes: \"Because red wine is easier to see than white wine, we pour 9 percent less red wine whenever we pour a glass.\"\nWansink said his researchers also found that people ate less at restaurants when sat in well-lighted areas near windows and doors, than in darker areas or in the back. They ate less if they were offered a doggie bag, or to-go box, before they got their meals: apparently the idea of getting a \"free\" second meal outweighed the impulse  to clean their plates. Workers who frequently ate at their desks weighed 15.4 pounds less, on average, than those who didn't. Fruits and vegetables kept on the top shelf of the refrigerator were eaten at higher rates than those on lower shelves.\nThe point, Wansink says, is to consider findings like those and change your environment or habits. Then you won't have to think about it: You'll just eat less. Question: According to Wansink, which of the following affects the amount of wine we drink:   _  .

Children often receive lucky money. Many people wear new clothes and send Chinese New Year greetings to each other. Various activities such as beating drums and striking gongs, as well as dragon and lion dances, are all part of the Spring Festival festivities.\nThe Spring Festival is a national holiday in China. Government offices, schools, universities and many companies are closed during the period from the Spring Festival Eve to the seventh day of the first lunar month in the Chinese calendar. However, some enterprises such as banks often arrange for workers to be on shift duty.

The role of children has changed as well as that of teens. The world has truly evolved  throughout the years.\nToday,a typical day in the life of a five year old is entirely different from what it once was. A few decades ago children used to work. They did the kind of work parents do today. Today there are shows on which children are putting pounds of makeup on and have flashing things all over their bodies. This makes a child want to _ all of their imperfections. They think they have to look perfect all the time.\nTeens have changed as well. My grandma got married when she was thirteen. Girls who had an arranged marriage had no time to play because they were expected to cook, clean,take care of the kids, and do housework every single day. Today,we go to school every morning, maybe participate in some after-school activities, and possibly go to work for extra cash. Then we go home and do homework, and eat. After all of this we have to find the time to socialize by texting, talking on the phone, or logging on to social networking sites. We enjoy ourselves a lot.\nThe generation before us complains about how they did not have the things we have now. They say we are not appreciative and do not value life or just do not care about our futures anymore. Let's make a change! The youth have the power to work on whatever they believe in and make a difference in the world. Take advantage of your resources. It is never too late to make a positive change in our world.

Let's have a look at what people in other countries do.\n    In the United States, thousands of people jam into Times Square in New York to welcome in the new year at midnight. The change from New Year's Eve and New Year's Day is very exciting. People count down   the seconds to welcome the new day as the New Year ball slowly gets down and lights up the area.\n    In Spain, when the clock strikes midnight, everyone eats 12 grapes. They eat one grape for each toll   to bring good luck for the next 12 months of the new year.\n    In Scotland, fireworks are set off in front of the Edinburgh Castle. Immediately after midnight, people sing Auld Lang Syne (<<>> ). The words are in Scottish and mean \"days gone by\". The famous Scottish poet Robert Burns wrote the song.\n    In Brazil, most people wear white clothes on New Year's Eve to bring good luck for the new year.
