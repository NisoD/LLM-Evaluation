The tall structure is usually a fixed object, such as a building, bridge or crane; but it is also possible to jump from a movable object, such as a hot-air balloon or helicopter, that has the ability to stay over one place on the ground; fixed-wing aircraft are unsuitable because they only stay high when moving quickly forward.\nWhen the person jumps, the cord stretches to absorb  the energy of the fall, then the jumper flies upwards again as the cord jumps back. The jumper oscillates up and down until all the energy is used up.\nThe word bungee first appeared around 1930 and was the name for a rubber eraser. The first modern bungee jumps were made on 1 April 1979 from the 250-foot Clifton Suspension Bridge in Bristol, by David Kirk, Chris Baker and Alan Weston of the Dangerous Sports Club. The jumpers continued with jumps in the US from the Golden Gate and Royal Gorge bridges, spreading the concept worldwide. By 1982 they were jumping from mobile cranes and hot-air balloons.

The tall structure is usually a fixed object, such as a building, bridge or crane; but it is also possible to jump from a movable object, such as a hot-air balloon or helicopter, that has the ability to stay over one place on the ground; fixed-wing aircraft are unsuitable because they only stay high when moving quickly forward.\nWhen the person jumps, the cord stretches to absorb  the energy of the fall, then the jumper flies upwards again as the cord jumps back. The jumper oscillates up and down until all the energy is used up.\nThe word bungee first appeared around 1930 and was the name for a rubber eraser. The first modern bungee jumps were made on 1 April 1979 from the 250-foot Clifton Suspension Bridge in Bristol, by David Kirk, Chris Baker and Alan Weston of the Dangerous Sports Club. The jumpers continued with jumps in the US from the Golden Gate and Royal Gorge bridges, spreading the concept worldwide. By 1982 they were jumping from mobile cranes and hot-air balloons. Later they put on commercial shows, which began in 1986.\nAs with any sport, injuries can still happen, and there have been deaths.

It's not the one I gave, because the situation was not right. As a lawyer in the entertainment industry, I knew the audience wanted to hear some amusing stories about my work with well-known people, but here's the true answer:\nThe most important thing I've ever done occurred on October 8,1990. I began the day playing tennis with an old friend I hadn't seen for a while. Between points we talked about what had been happening in each other's lives. He and his wife had just had a baby boy, who was keeping them up at night.\nWhile we were playing, a car came screaming up the road toward the courts. It was my friend's father, who shouted to my friend that his baby had stopped breathing and was being rushed to the hospital. In a flash my friend was in the car and gone, disappearing in a cloud of dust.\nFor a moment I just stood there, paralyzed . Then I tried to figure out what I should do. Follow my friend to the hospital? There was nothing I could accomplish there, I convinced myself. My friend's son was in the care of doctors and nurses, and nothing I could do or say would affect the outcome. Be there for moral support? Well, maybe. But my friend and his wife both had large families, and I knew they'd be surrounded by relatives who would provide more than enough comfort and support, whatever happened. All I could do at the hospital, I decided, was to get in the way. Also, I had planned a full day with my family, who were waiting for me to get home. So I decided to head back to my house and check in my friend later.\nAs I started my car, I realized that my friend had left his truck and keys at the courts. I now faced another problem. I couldn't leave the keys in the truck. So I decided to go to the hospital and give him the keys.\nWhen I arrived, I was directed to a room where my friend and his wife were waiting. As I had thought, the room was filled with family members silently watching my friend comfort his wife. I went in and stood by the door, trying to decide what to do next. Soon a doctor appeared. He approached my friend and his wife, and in a quiet voice told them that their son had died.\nFor a long time the two held each other and cried, unaware of the rest of us standing around in pained silence. After they had calmed themselves, the doctor suggested they spend a few moments with their son.\nMy friend and his wife stood up and walked past their families. When they reached the door, my friend saw me standing in the corner. He came over and hugged me and started to cry. My friend's wife hugged me, too, and said , \"Thanks for being here.\"\nFor the rest of that morning, I sat in the emergency room of that hospital and watched my friend and his wife hold the body of their infant son, and say goodbye.\nIt's the most important thing I have ever done. The experience taught me two lessons.\nFirst: The most important thing I've ever done happened when I was completely helpless. None of the things I had learned in university, in three years of law school or in six years of legal practice were of any use in that situation. Something terrible was happening to people I cared about, and I was powerless to change the outcome. All I could do was standing by and watching it happen. And yet it was critical that I do just that--- just be there when someone needed me.\nSecond: The most important thing I've done almost didn't happen because of things I had learned in classroom and professional life. Law school taught me how to take a set of facts, break them down and organized them. These skills are critical for lawyers. When people come to us for help, they're often stressed out and depend on a lawyer to think logically. But while learning to think, I almost forget how to feel. Today I have no doubt that I should have leapt into my car without hesitation and followed my friend to the hospital.\nFrom that one experience I learned that the most important thing in life isn't the money you make, the status you attain or the honors you achieve.

The sun shines, the wind blows, and time and space seem endless. Nothing is soft. The sand and rocks are hard, and many of the plants even have hard needles instead of leaves.\nThe size and location  of the world's deserts are always changing. Over millions of years, as climates change and mountains rise, new dry and wet areas develop. But within the last 100 yeas, deserts have been growing at a frightening speed. This is partly because of natural changes, but the greatest makers are humans.\nHumans can make deserts, but humans can also prevent their growth. Algeria Mauritania is planting a similar wall around   Nouakchott, the capital. Iran puts a thin covering of petroleum  on sandy areas and plants trees. The oil keeps the water and small trees in the land, and men on motorcycles  keep the sheep and goats away. The USSR and India are building long canals to bring water to desert areas.

From the time they got married, they wouldn't be separated. She followed him to wars, advised him on affairs of state, and was loved by his people for her good work. But she died in 1631 during childbirth. The emperor was heart-broken and had the Taj Mahal built as a sign of his love.\nIt took more than 20 years for the Taj Mahal to be built. Workers were brought in, not only from all over India, but from Central Asia too. A total of 20,000 people worked on the building.\nIn 1657, Shah Jahan fell ill, and in 1658 his son Aurangzeb, imprisoned   his father and seized power.

Researchers have been unsuccessfully looking for a solution.\nThe 16-year old Canadian high school student, Daniel Burd, from Waterloo Collegiate Institute,\nhas discovered a way to make plastic bags degrade  in as few as 3 months, a finding that won him first prize at the Canada-Wide Science Fair, a $10 000 prize, a $20 000 scholarship, and a chance to revolutionize a major environmental issue.\nBurd's strategy was simple: Since plastic does eventually degrade, it must be eaten by microorganisms  . If those microorganisms could be identified, we could put them to work eating the plastic much faster than under normal conditions.\nWith this goal in mind, he ground plastic bags into a powder and concocted  a solution of household chemicals, yeast  and tap water to encourage microbes growth. Then he added the plastic powder and let the microbes work their magic for 3 months. Finally, he tested the resulting bacterial culture on plastic bags, exposing one plastic sample to dead bacteria as a control. Sure enough, the plastic exposed to the live bacteria was 17% lighter than the control after six weeks.\nThe inputs are cheap: maintaining the required temperature takes little energy because microbes produce heat as they work, and the only outputs are water and tiny levels of carbon dioxide.\n\"Almost every week I have to do chores and when I open the closet door, I have piles of plastic bags falling on top of me.

At this camp for children with life-threatening illnesses, we had seen some pretty tough children worn out by cancer recover full of energy despite their illness. But we saw little progress in David no matter what we tried with him. Five days into the eight-day session saw a quiet, sad little pirate.\n Then something happened on that fifth night. Something at camp that we would call \"huge\". \nIt was cabin night. That's the time when campers and counselors spend lime together in each individual cabin instead of an all-camp activity.

The campers went crazy as everyone ran to the table to get in on the fun of smashing potato chips with their fists.\nSomehow everyone knew, everyone sensed, that anger within him was now being released. \nFor the last couple days of the session, David was a different kid. He was a little nine-year-old boy again, trying to fill the hours of each remaining day at camp with as much fun as could be possible.\nSeveral days after the session, David came back again. This time, there wasn't anything he wouldn't try to fit in to his day. He sure was having a great time at camp. David asked me if I needed an altar boy when I celebrated Mass in the woods. Sure enough, he was my altar boy. I remembered how carefully he listened to me when I talked about death. 1 said it's only a doorway. You walk through the door and there's the Lord God and behind God a whole line of people waiting to hug you.\nAfter Mass, he said to me, \"Hey Fatha, a door, huh?\"\nA couple more days of fun passed and tonight was the talent show. The tradition is that campers and counselors dress up in costumes, and everyone gets a standing applause for singing and dancing or simply just acting like fools on stage.\n The show had begun: lights, camera, action.\nUnfortunately, the only action taking place in our row of seats was little David making his way from counselor to counselor to say an early good-bye to camp. He had become quite ill and had to go to the hospital because of this new crisis.\nWhen this little nine-year-old pirate stood in front of me, he gave me a hug and a big wet kiss on my cheek. 1 was crying.

It's a time when information is of primary importance. It's a time when new information technologies are fundamentally transforming the world in every aspect. Among the changes, which have come upon modern society, the ones in education are probably the most obvious and influential. New information technologies are accelerating changes in education, at the same time presenting revolutionary tools with the potential to make education more efficient and more effective than ever.\nThe application of new information technologies has remarkably promoted the process of education. Online learning is probably the best case in point. As is often the case with \"technology\", online learning may appear to be horrible; it can sound like alphabet soup sometimes. Now let's see whether you can understand all this. You can participate in CBT at a CLC via the convenience of IDL. What does it all mean? Let me translate: GBT--Computer-Based Training; CLC--Computer Learning Center; IDL--Interactive Distance Learning. Sound complicated? Not really. Online learning is much less complicated than it seems. Students can learn at any time, anywhere, at any speed. They can make their own learning schedules and follow their own paths to suit their lifestyles. In my university, every semester there're several online courses available, which need no class meetings or paper materials. The only thing I have to do is just to get online regularly as I wish, and download necessary learning materials. Then everything I need to know about the course is only a click away.\nBut online learning is not perfect; it's like the microwave oven: it does some things better, but it is not a complete replacement for the traditional model. The traditional classroom model for education and learning is hard to leave behind. Because humans are social creatures, there're times when we need to see each other face-to-face for interactive learning. A social and personal connection often builds effective teams, solves problems, and inspires confidence. So one possible solution is to combine online learning with the old traditional classroom learning , which not only makes the learning process faster and cheaper, but also highlights the interactions between teachers and students.\nThe bottom line: the Internet is the most important educational tool in the information age and online learning will become a main part of every individual's learning experience in the future. That's exactly how we will move knowledge from the ones who have it to the ones who need it faster and cheaper, and that's how we're going to survive in the information age.

In Wansink's research, \"women who had even one box of breakfast cereal that was visible-anywhere in their kitchen--weighed 21 pounds more than their neighbor who didn't.\"\nTrick yourself into drinking less wine. \"We tend to focus on the height of what we pour and not the width, so we pour 12 percent less wine into taller wineglasses than we pour into wider wineglasses.\" And the shape of the glass is not the only variable that affects how much we drink.

Is it best to tell him the truth? If he asks, should the doctor reject that he is ill, or minimize the gravity of the illness? Should they at least hide the truth until after the family vacation?\nDoctors face such choices often. At times, they see important reasons to lie for the patient's own sake; in their eyes, such lies differ sharply from self-serving ones.\nStudies show that most doctors sincerely believe that the seriously ill patients do not want to know the truth about their condition, and that informing them risks destroying their hope, so that they may recover more slowly, or deteriorate   faster, perhaps even commit suicide.\nBut other studies show that, contrary to the belief of many physicians; a great majority of patients do want to be told the truth, even about serious illness, and feel cheated when they learn that they have been misled. We are also learning that truthful information, humanly conveyed, helps patients cope this illness: help them tolerate pain better, need less medicine, and even recover faster after operation.\nThere is urgent need to debate this issue openly. Not only in medicine, but in other professions as well, practitioners may find themselves repeatedly in difficulty where serious consequences seem avoidable only through deception  . Yet the public has every reason to know professional deception, for such practices are peculiarly likely to become deeply rooted, to spread, and to trust. Neither in medicine, nor in law, government, or the social sciences can there be comfort in the old saying, \"What you don't know can't hurt you.\" Question: From the passage, we can learn that the author's attitude to professional deception is    _   .

We just mean that it's common for older people to become a little shorter over time. This kind of shrinking can't be reversed, although people can slow or stop this process. But why does shrinking happen at all?\nBecause of gravity (the force that keeps your feet on the ground) , cushions between the bones in the spine  , get compressed  , which makes a person lose a little height and become shorter.\nAnother reason why some older people shrink is because of osteoporosis  . Osteoporosis occurs when bone is broken down and not enough new bone material is made. Over time, bone is said to be lost because it's not being replaced. Bones become smaller and weaker and can easily break if someone with osteoporosis is injured.\nOlder people--especially women, who generally have smaller and lighter bones to begin with--are more likely to develop osteoporosis. As years go by, a person with osteoporosis can get small breaks in bones that are called compression fractures . These breaks cause collapse of the spine and over time the person with osteoporosis can become hunched over  .\nDid you know that every day you shrink a little, too?

The soft handwriting reflected a thoughtful soul and insightful mind. In the front of the book, he discovered the previous owner's name, Miss Hollis Maynell. With time and effort he located her address. She lived in New York City. He wrote her a letter introducing himself and inviting her to correspond. The next day he was shipped overseas for service in World War II.\nDuring the next year and one month the two grew to know each other through the mail. Each letter was a seed falling on a fertile heart. A romance was starting Blanchard requested a photograph, but she refused. She felt that if he really cared, it wouldn't matter what she looked like.\nWhen the day finally came for him to return from Europe, they scheduled their first meeting --7:00 PM at the Grand Central Station in New York. \"You'll recognize me,\" she wrote, \"by the red rose I'll be wearing on my lapel.\" So at 7:00 he was in the station looking for a girl whose heart he loved, but whose face he'd never seen.\nI'll let Mr. Blanchard tell you what happened: A young woman was coming toward me, her figure long and slim. Her blonde hair lay back in curls from her delicate ears; her eyes were blue as flowers. Her lips and chin had a gentle firmness, and in her pale green suit she was like springtime come alive. I stared at her, entirely forgetting to notice that she was not wearing a rose. As I moved, a small, attractive smile curved her lips. \"Going my way , sailor?\" she murmured.\nAlmost uncontrollably I made one step closer to her, and then I saw Hollis Maynell. She was standing almost directly behind the girl. A woman well past 40, she had graying hair tucked under a worn hat. She was more than plump, her thick-ankled feet thrust into low-heeled shoes. The girl in the green suit was walking quickly away. I felt as though I was split in two, so keen was my desire to follow her, and yet so deep was my longing for the woman whose spirit had truly companioned me and upheld my own.\nAnd there she stood. Her pale, plump face was gentle and sensible, her gray eyes had a warm and kindly twinkle. I did not hesitate. My fingers gripped the small worn blue leather copy of the book that was to identify me to her.\nThis would not be love, but it would be something precious, something perhaps even better than love, a friendship for which I had been and must ever be grateful. I squared my shoulders and saluted and held out the book to the woman, even though while I spoke I felt choked by the bitterness of my disappointment.  \"I'm Lieutenant John Blanchard, and you must be Miss Maynell. I am so glad you could meet me; may I take you to dinner?\"\nThe woman's face broadened into a tolerant smile. \"I don't know what this is about, son,\" she answered, \"but the young lady in the green suit who just went by, she begged me to wear this rose on my coat. And she said if you were to ask me out to dinner, I should go and tell you that she is waiting for you in the big restaurant across the street.

Taking a book off the shelf he found himself intrigued, not with the words of the book, but with the notes penciled in the margin. The soft handwriting reflected a thoughtful soul and insightful mind. In the front of the book, he discovered the previous owner's name, Miss Hollis Maynell. With time and effort he located her address. She lived in New York City. He wrote her a letter introducing himself and inviting her to correspond. The next day he was shipped overseas for service in World War II.\nDuring the next year and one month the two grew to know each other through the mail. Each letter was a seed falling on a fertile heart. A romance was starting Blanchard requested a photograph, but she refused. She felt that if he really cared, it wouldn't matter what she looked like.\nWhen the day finally came for him to return from Europe, they scheduled their first meeting --7:00 PM at the Grand Central Station in New York. \"You'll recognize me,\" she wrote, \"by the red rose I'll be wearing on my lapel.\" So at 7:00 he was in the station looking for a girl whose heart he loved, but whose face he'd never seen.\nI'll let Mr. Blanchard tell you what happened: A young woman was coming toward me, her figure long and slim. Her blonde hair lay back in curls from her delicate ears; her eyes were blue as flowers. Her lips and chin had a gentle firmness, and in her pale green suit she was like springtime come alive. I stared at her, entirely forgetting to notice that she was not wearing a rose. As I moved, a small, attractive smile curved her lips. \"Going my way , sailor?\" she murmured.\nAlmost uncontrollably I made one step closer to her, and then I saw Hollis Maynell. She was standing almost directly behind the girl. A woman well past 40, she had graying hair tucked under a worn hat. She was more than plump, her thick-ankled feet thrust into low-heeled shoes. The girl in the green suit was walking quickly away. I felt as though I was split in two, so keen was my desire to follow her, and yet so deep was my longing for the woman whose spirit had truly companioned me and upheld my own.\nAnd there she stood. Her pale, plump face was gentle and sensible, her gray eyes had a warm and kindly twinkle. I did not hesitate. My fingers gripped the small worn blue leather copy of the book that was to identify me to her.\nThis would not be love, but it would be something precious, something perhaps even better than love, a friendship for which I had been and must ever be grateful. I squared my shoulders and saluted and held out the book to the woman, even though while I spoke I felt choked by the bitterness of my disappointment.  \"I'm Lieutenant John Blanchard, and you must be Miss Maynell. I am so glad you could meet me; may I take you to dinner?\"\nThe woman's face broadened into a tolerant smile. \"I don't know what this is about, son,\" she answered, \"but the young lady in the green suit who just went by, she begged me to wear this rose on my coat. And she said if you were to ask me out to dinner, I should go and tell you that she is waiting for you in the big restaurant across the street. She said it was some kind of test!\"\nIt's not difficult to understand and admire Miss Maynell's wisdom. The true nature of a heart is seen in its response to the unattractive. \"Tell me whom you love,\" Houssaye wrote, \"And I will tell you who you are. \" Question: Which of the following can be the best title for the passage?

Here is a list of practical steps you can take to prepare and protect yourself and your family.\n1) Know the symptoms-- Here are some of the symptoms that sound like swine flu -- fevers over 100 degrees (37.8degC), body aches, cough, runny nose, and sometimes, nausea   and diarrhea  . It's also useful to know if you might have had an exposure   either by recent travel to Mexico, or to the areas of known cases so far in America -- specific areas of California, Texas, New York, Ohio and Kansas. Or you may have been exposed to a sick person who came from those areas. \n2) Don't panic-- If you have symptoms that sound like swine flu, do not rush to hospitals. Not only is this difficult for the healthcare system, it can also be potentially dangerous for everyone. Call your doctor or local public health clinic before going in.\n3) Contain the illness-- Hand-washing works. Wash, wash and wash. Invest in some hand sanitizer   for the whole family. Avoid hugs and kisses of well-wishers, and do not share telephone handsets or computers. Be especially careful to always cough into the elbow of your arm (yes! the elbow, not your hand!). Cover your cough and sneeze to protect others. \n4) What about a mask?-- The data shows that masks do work --as long asthere is a tight seal   about the mouth and nose. \n5) Eat the pork(if you want) -- Swine flu gets its name because pigs can get the infection and spread it to each other -- as well as to humans. This latest virus contains pieces that indicate it evolved   from swine flu virus, and can now spread from person to person. Swine flu is not spread by properly prepared and cooked pork products. So if you want to eat pork, you can.\n6) Getting sick? Stay home!-- In our go-go-go culture and these severe economic times, it can be very hard to call a boss and cancel a day's work. Now, however, if you or your loved ones are feeling like there's a flu coming on, stay home.\n7) Stockpile?-- Right now, it's too early for any of us to become a Swine Flu Shut-In, but the public health department recommends that each home have two weeks of supplies, in case we must stay home -- either for illness or to help contain transmission. That means two weeks of food for everyone in your home, two weeks of all medications, and, if you're like most people, two weeks of books and DVDs.

These groups are the American Society for Microbiology and the American Cleaning Institute, formerly the Soap and Detergent Association.\nThere was good news in the latest study. Researchers found that eighty-five percent of adults washed their hands in public restrooms last month. That was the most since the studies began in 1996.\nResearchers visited restrooms at a baseball park in Atlanta and a science museum and aquarium  in Chicago. They also visited two train stations in New York City and a large farmers' market in San Francisco. In all, they observed about six thousand adults, with females and males equal in number.\nThe researchers found that seventy-seven percent of men and ninety-three percent of women washed their hands. That was up from sixty-six percent of men and eighty-eight percent of women in the last study three years ago.\nThe lowest rate of hand washing among men was at Turner Field, home of the Atlanta Braves baseball team. Only sixty-five percent of men washed their hands, compared to all but two percent of women.\nChicago and San Francisco had the most hand washers--eighty-nine percent of adults.

These groups are the American Society for Microbiology and the American Cleaning Institute, formerly the Soap and Detergent Association.\nThere was good news in the latest study. Researchers found that eighty-five percent of adults washed their hands in public restrooms last month. That was the most since the studies began in 1996.\nResearchers visited restrooms at a baseball park in Atlanta and a science museum and aquarium  in Chicago. They also visited two train stations in New York City and a large farmers' market in San Francisco. In all, they observed about six thousand adults, with females and males equal in number.\nThe researchers found that seventy-seven percent of men and ninety-three percent of women washed their hands. That was up from sixty-six percent of men and eighty-eight percent of women in the last study three years ago.\nThe lowest rate of hand washing among men was at Turner Field, home of the Atlanta Braves baseball team. Only sixty-five percent of men washed their hands, compared to all but two percent of women.\nChicago and San Francisco had the most hand washers--eighty-nine percent of adults.

However, many people know little else about this wonderful animal. The word cheetah probably comes from a Hindi word spotted animal. It is very similar to other cats but also has some obvious differences. Its body is much leaner than most cats and it has much longer legs.\nPeople sometimes make a cheetah a leopard because they both have spots, but in fact they are very different. A leopard is far heavier and more powerful, but also much slower. The cheetah's spots cover most of its body except for its stomach and throat. The cheetah's tail has spots and these become rings at the end of the tail.\nAn adult cheetah weighs between 35-65 kilograms and is about 80 centimeters high at the shoulder. The cheetah's head is quite small and the eyes are quite high up. A black line runs from each eye down to its mouth and makes it look a little sad. It has high shoulders that help it to walk so gracefully.\nCheetahs are very fast but they are not very strong. They are not good fighters and will run away rather than fight another animal to protect their food. If they make a kill, it is sometimes taken away from them by stronger animals such as lions and leopard. These animals will kill their young if they get the chance.

However, when this emotion bleeds into other aspects of our life, it can sometimes be inappropriate or even harmful.\nI was personally discouraged by an adult during my high school. After telling her what university I wanted to attend, she plainly told me I would not get in. I was completely shocked and angry at her statement. The adult may have not intended to hurt me with her words, but it had an after effect. The meeting made me think she had no belief that I could possibly succeed in the future. After that it caused me to try to avoid any future meeting with adults until absolutely necessary.\nWe are all human; therefore, we can all understand that some days are more challenging. But when people allow situations of stress to consume  them, they cannot perform their best. People should pay attention to how their reactions could affect the person they are interacting with. People have the potential to perform their best when they _ the task at hand, but adults who come off in a rude and aggressive way through communication have an effect on teenagers' mind.\nAdults whether in schools, or any other institutions should work to tear down walls gently and create a safe space for the person they are serving. These adults should also help and contribute to a person's academic, personal and professional growth. High school is an important time when young people need someone to believe in them.\nIn conclusion, I would like to add that it is not completely up to adults only.

Students can expect to be treated in a respectful way when they express at the beginning. Generally the responsibility lies on both parties.

However, as the pattern of having two children in a family is challenged by modern family units, there are a few reasons why it is not selfish to want only one child. \nToday, the role of women has changed a lot. But nowadays, a wife has to help her husband earn the bread and butter as well as well as looking after her family. In demanding times like these, a woman has to put in more physical and emotional effort than any other member of the family. \nRaising a child comes at a cost that remains only heard of, until you find yourself paying it. The good reality of double income with no kids suddenly comes crashing down when there is a child involved in the picture. When one parent (the mother) needs to take some time off to look after the newborn, only one person becomes the earning member. Of course, the expenses went up rapidly. According to Susan Newman, PhD, a social psychologist, the average cost of raising a child is $227,000 from birth to college.\nMost young mothers also think that having one child would mean that there is more income for the child, and thus, better facilities can be provided. It is much easier to educate a single child at a good school, and give him/her better life with more resources at hand. \nWith several children in the house, it becomes increasingly difficult to find ways to spend time with all of them. Dividing your time with just one child means that you can devote a little more time to doing the things you want to. In a single child unit, there are less comparison and more chances for positive motivation to learn new things.

However, as the pattern of having two children in a family is challenged by modern family units, there are a few reasons why it is not selfish to want only one child. \nToday, the role of women has changed a lot. But nowadays, a wife has to help her husband earn the bread and butter as well as well as looking after her family. In demanding times like these, a woman has to put in more physical and emotional effort than any other member of the family. \nRaising a child comes at a cost that remains only heard of, until you find yourself paying it. The good reality of double income with no kids suddenly comes crashing down when there is a child involved in the picture. When one parent (the mother) needs to take some time off to look after the newborn, only one person becomes the earning member. Of course, the expenses went up rapidly. According to Susan Newman, PhD, a social psychologist, the average cost of raising a child is $227,000 from birth to college.\nMost young mothers also think that having one child would mean that there is more income for the child, and thus, better facilities can be provided. It is much easier to educate a single child at a good school, and give him/her better life with more resources at hand. \nWith several children in the house, it becomes increasingly difficult to find ways to spend time with all of them. Dividing your time with just one child means that you can devote a little more time to doing the things you want to. In a single child unit, there are less comparison and more chances for positive motivation to learn new things. A happy child, who deserves the rightful attention, love, care, and time from both the parents, always gets a meaningful childhood, for both the parents and the child.

But if you want to save a little water and reuse it on your lawns or plants --- or even use it for laundry, dishes, or other needs --- collecting rainwater from your gutter's downspouts  is a _ \nAccording to John C. Davis, writing in E / The Environmental Magazine, just about any homeowner can collect rainwater, given that the roof and gutters do most of the work. And since an inch of rain falling on a 2,000-square-foot roof produces some 1,200 gallons of water, you can harvest enough to water your lawn or garden.\nPlants and grass actually do better when fed rainwater instead of tap water, which is usually treated with substances that can hold back plant growth. Using rainwater can also extend the life of pipes, since the salts added to tap water may gradually damage the pipes. However, homeowners should set up a water purification system if they do plan to use rainwater for inside needs.\nRainwater harvesting can also be good for the local community, as it reduces the erosion, flooding, and pollution associated with heavy rainfall, and reduces dependence on public water supplies. So some states fund rainwater collection systems in their local communities.\nMany varieties of rain barrel  systems, starting at just $100, are available for home use. A typical setup is simply a rain barrel positioned under a gutter's downspout. Skillful homeowners can make their own water harvesting systems, but buying one is a lot easier.

Perhaps you can do both at the same time.\nWhen choosing a career, one of the things you must consider is your interests. Why then do so many people not even think about their hobbies when a hobby is, in fact, an interest?

After all, no one ever said your hobby had to stay separate from your occupation. In addition people are usually very skilled at their hobbies. The combination of interest and skill is a very compelling   reason to choose a particular career.\n\"Who's going to hire someone who loves making beaded   jewelry?\" you may ask yourself. Good question. Don't wait for someone to hire you. Start your own business. That may be the best way to combine your hobby with your career.

Before you go forward with your plans, though, you should find out whether being an entrepreneur   is for you.\nWhen you attempt to turn your hobby into a career, don't forget to do your homework.

These schools teach more than one thousand children.

She has worked hard to pay for their education. She spends almost all her income to pay her son's tuition to study engineering at Kabul University.\nBut seeking higher education for her four daughters is difficult. There is not enough money or secondary schools for girls in the village.\nThe Afghan teacher hopes more and more children will receive an education in Afghanistan.

If, when I speak to you, I repeat the same things thousand and one times, do not interrupt me, listen to me. When you were small, I had to read to you thousand and one times the same story until you got to sleep. When I do not want to have a shower, neither shame me nor scold me. Remember when I had to chase you with thousand excuses I invented, in order that you wanted to breathe. When you see my knowing little about new technologies, give me the necessary time and do not look at me with your mocking  smile. I taught you how to do so many things: to eat good, to dress well, to confront life... When at some moment I lose the memory or the thread of our conversation, let me have the necessary time to remember, and if I cannot do it, do not become nervous, as the most important thing is not our conversation but surely to be with you and to have you listening to me.\nIf ever I do not want to eat, do not force me. I know well when I need to and when not. When my tired legs do not allow me to walk, give me your hand, the same way I did when you made your first step. And when someday I say to you that I do not want to live anymore--that I want to rest forever, do not get angry. Someday you will understand.\nTry to understand that _ .

But a new study suggests they used a little rock'n'roll. Long-ago builders could have attached wooden poles to the stones and rolled them across the sand, the scientists say.\n\"Technically, I think what they're proposing is possible,\" physicist Daniel Bonn said.\nPeople have long puzzled over how the Egyptians moved such huge rocks. And there's no obvious answer. On average, each of the two million big stones weighed about as much as a large pickup truck. The Egyptians somehow moved the stone blocks to the pyramid site from about one kilometer away.\nThe most popular view is that Egyptian workers slid the blocks along smooth paths. Many scientists suspect wokers first would have put the blocks on sleds . Then they would have dragged them along paths. To make the work easier, workers may have lubricated the paths either with wet clay or with the fat from cattle. Bonn has now tested this idea by building small sleds and dragging heavy objects over sand.\nEvidence from the sand supports this idea. Researchers found small amounts of fat, as well as a large amount of stone and the remains of paths.\nHowever , physicist Joseph West think there might have been a simpler way , who led the new study . West said , \"I was inspired while watching a television program showing how sleds might have helped with pyramid construction . I thought , \"Why don't they just try rolling the things ? \" A square could be turned into a rough sort of wheel by attaching wooden poles to its sides , he realized . That , he notes , should make a block of stone \"a lot easier to roll than a square\".\nSo he tried _ \nHe and his students tied some poles to each of four sides of a 30-kilogram stone block.That action turned the block into somewhat a wheel.Then they placed the block on the ground.\nThey wrapped one end of a rope around the block and pulled.The researchers found they could easily roll the block along different kinds of paths.They calculated that rolling the block required about as much force as moving it along a slippery path.\nWest hasn't tested his idea on larger blocks,but he thinks rolling has clear advantages over sliding.At least,workers wouldn't have needed to carry cattle fat or water to smooth the paths.

Because of this, most people think that craft no longer exists.\nOne of the ways these people wrongly support their view is by pointing to 100-year-old homes which are still solid, and arguing that it is the craftsmanship that is responsible for their durability. \"Homes in those days were well-built,\" _ say. No doubt these homes were well-built, but what these people have done is mix up the quality of material used in the house with the quality of the craftsmanship.\nHomes today could be built to last just as long as those old homes if people were willing or able to pay the price. For example, most people can no longer afford solid oak stairways, although they were once fairly common in older homes. Nor can they afford the high labor cost of employing a carpenter to build the stairway. Yet if someone can pay the high cost, there are still plenty of carpenters around able to make those stairways. And not only would these carpenters know how to build them, they would probably do a better job than carpenters of old.\nOne thing the modern carpenter has which enables him to do a better job is much more advanced tools. Such tools as laser beams and powerplanes help them lay out a house better and make more precision cuts on the wood. Also, it is not uncommon say more to find carpenters with college degrees and carpenters with a solid knowledge of mathematics, which would enable them to deal with more difficult house designs.\nThe problem of modern quality, then, really boils down to the problem of material, for the modern carpenter is just as able to produce craftsmanship as the carpenter of fifty years ago, but only if given proper material.

Anger and negative energy have a strong influence on everyone's life, even when they don't realize it.\nBeing in a calm state of mind is simply wonderful. Results of this can be seen when parents no longer shout at their children over any small thing and when one can keep him cool when bad things happen and doesn't let the situation become worse by his negative influence.\nAlso results can be seen on a larger scale. In 1993 a very interesting scientific experiment called The US Transcendental Meditation experiment was conducted in Washington. A company called TM got 4,000 calm and relaxed people to simply sit and meditate   in a central Washington convention center. The results of this experiment showed that during those particular 8 weeks, violent crimes, such as murder, rape, assaults, clearly decreased by as much as 23%.\nThis is evident proof that meditation can change the state of mind, bring back peace of mind and collective meditation is contagious  , just as anything done collectively is contagious. For example, a person has the urge to become aggressive (while in normal circumstances that person is very calm and normal), just because he is sitting at a stadium watching a football game and everyone around is shouting and is aggressive.\nIsn't increasing the quality of life worth spending 20 minutes of time on meditation? Yes, very few people follow through with a meditation method that should be a joy to do. Many start and leave it after only a few sessions.\nSo if collective meditation has proven that meditation works, that it calms people down and that it brings their levels of stress down, why not employ it in everyday life? Question: Which of the following statements is NOT true according to the passage? Choices: A. Violent crimes are closely related to aggressive characters., B. Many people fail to carry out a meditation method., C. People are sometimes easily annoyed by small things., D. Meditation can cure people of many illnesses. Answer:\n", "Result": "B. Many people fail to carry out a meditation method.", "GroundTruth": "D. Meditation can cure people of many illnesses."}]}}
