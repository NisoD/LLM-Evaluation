Choices: I. A nuclear blast produces EMP, a thermal light pulse, blast, and fallout at the moment of detonation. The electro-magnetic pulse occurs when gamma radiation interacts with matter (the atmosphere), \"the Compton effect.\" EMP produces a high voltage charge, harmless to humans but destructive to electronic systems. EMP effects are maximized at high altitude. However thermal-light pulse can produce flash blindness, retinal burn, and fire whilst the airburst can cause severe skin burns. OR II.

The different relationship to the concept of security: in Europe the debate has stayed as part of politico-self-reflection of the scholar who 'does security;' whereas in the US, the question of the concept of security is seen at the most a necessary 'define your' terms' operation. OR II. In the US major competing explanations emphasized, on the one hand, the US's liberal hegemony, and, on the other hand, the purely power based stability of presumed unipolarity in which balancing becomes impossible. OR III. The different relationship to the exact form of knowledge that is valued. The US is more rationalist, Europe the more reflectivist.

Choices: I. Feminist and critical security theory shows us that war can have gendered consequences. Recognition of those consequences has allowed us to address the way in which we think about 'male' and 'female' expectations in warfare, and has shaped the way in which we theorise, participate, and protest against those roles. OR II. Gendered consequences of security issues have not challenged international relations theory. Constructivist theories of the state were mainstreamed without undermining the ideas of state as the centre of military power, or as the highest organization of human community. OR III. Investigations into the consequences of state security policies showed that women were subject to masculine dominated war policies as the likely victims as casualties of war or as post conflict targets. Women are increasingly subject to violence as a product of social circumstance. OR IV. The literature that emerged in the 1980s and 1990s was primarily concerned with the ways in which women had served the purposes of nationalist campaigns, focusing on the biological characteristics of women as sexually reproductive beings, and with little focus on critical analysis.

Choices: I. Large terrorist organizations are hard to penetrate, being highly cohesive and centralized in structure. In both the warfare and criminal model, intelligence is obtained by two methods; firstly to elicit information from captured terrorists or secondly from an informer within the group. An intelligence coup greatly enhances the prospect of stopping terrorist operations once the larger group has been compromised. OR II. Prevention is conceived as securing the physical integrity of targets and key political installations, particularly weapons installations, national buildings, national or cultural symbols, or defence deployments. Protecting possible targets of the state enhances the wellbeing of more vulnerable targets. Terrorists may move to more convenient territory to target their objectives which make it more difficult to control. OR III. Prevention of terrorism is a highly controversial policy designed to reduce the appeal of terrorism within the population through reform packages. The method is characterized by diplomatic exchanges. However, as a preventative method it has been questioned and it is argued to resemble concessionary politics. OR IV. Prevention is normally associated with the concept of terrorism as war or crime. All governments will practice prevention (seen as repression from the terrorist perspective) by seeking to arrest or eliminate those actively involved in the violence. Security forces attack the terrorists before they strike (war) or they are arrested after the attack (crime). Answer:\n", "Result": "\nII.

Choices: I. Generally the distinction between brute and limited force is negligible. Resort to air or sea power constitutes an equal coercive capacity to a conventional ground offensive. Military action always results from a failure of negotiations and from a shift from the diplomatic to the military sphere. OR II. The distinction between limited force and full-scale force is the second process of coercive diplomacy. Coercive diplomacy only fails if the coercer fails to achieve its defined goals and fails to defeat its adversary in the second stage. OR III. The distinction between limited force and brute force is important because the amount of force that is used to attain the coercer's interests defines the type of outcome that is achieved. If a positive policy outcome is achieved, then we can say that limited force has been employed. OR IV. The distinction between limited force and full-scale war is crucial because resort to brute force means that diplomacy has failed. The distinction is not based on the amount of force or the type, but on the purpose that the use of force seeks to accomplish and the element of choice left to the adversary.

What are the inherent difficulties? Choices: I. Coercive diplomacy leaves too much room for compromise.

As a consequence coercive diplomacy can lead to lengthy resolution discussions. OR II.
