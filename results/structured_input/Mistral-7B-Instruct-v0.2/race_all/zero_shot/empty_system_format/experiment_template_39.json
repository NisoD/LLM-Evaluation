The tall structure is usually a fixed object, such as a building, bridge or crane; but it is also possible to jump from a movable object, such as a hot-air balloon or helicopter, that has the ability to stay over one place on the ground; fixed-wing aircraft are unsuitable because they only stay high when moving quickly forward.\nWhen the person jumps, the cord stretches to absorb  the energy of the fall, then the jumper flies upwards again as the cord jumps back.

The tall structure is usually a fixed object, such as a building, bridge or crane; but it is also possible to jump from a movable object, such as a hot-air balloon or helicopter, that has the ability to stay over one place on the ground; fixed-wing aircraft are unsuitable because they only stay high when moving quickly forward.\nWhen the person jumps, the cord stretches to absorb  the energy of the fall, then the jumper flies upwards again as the cord jumps back. The jumper oscillates up and down until all the energy is used up.\nThe word bungee first appeared around 1930 and was the name for a rubber eraser.

According to the modern legend, he is a magical figure who visits all the children of the world during the night before Christmas Day, leaving presents which they find the next morning. He flies through the night sky in a sledge pulled by reindeer, and enters houses by climbing down chimneys. This strange legend is based on the life of a man called Nicholas, but in fact we know very little about him. Historians think he was a Christian bishop in Turkey in about 285--350 A.D. One of the stories about him is that he helped three poor girls. No one would marry them because they were so poor. To provide them with money for their weddings, Nicholas secretly dropped some gold coins down the chimney of their house. After Nicholas died, he was made a saint  by the church.(The name Santa Claus thus comes from St Nicholas.) His feast day was celebrated in December, and parents started giving their children secret presents from St Nicholas. Over the years, this custom became part of our Christmas traditions.\nRecently, a psychologist has claimed that Father Christmas is \"the perfect fantasy\" for children. According to Professor Anthony Clare, children love the character of Father Christmas because he is like an ideal father: he loves children and gives them presents, but he never criticizes them, is never angry, and children do not even need to thank him for the presents. Other writers, however, point out that Father Christmas can be a frightening character to some children. Jane Bidder says that some children are terrified of this fat, bearded old man. It can certainly confuse many children. As parents, we warn our children to be careful of strangers and never to let them into the house, and yet we tell children that a strange man will come into their bedroom at night!

It's not the one I gave, because the situation was not right. As a lawyer in the entertainment industry, I knew the audience wanted to hear some amusing stories about my work with well-known people, but here's the true answer:\nThe most important thing I've ever done occurred on October 8,1990. I began the day playing tennis with an old friend I hadn't seen for a while. Between points we talked about what had been happening in each other's lives. He and his wife had just had a baby boy, who was keeping them up at night.\nWhile we were playing, a car came screaming up the road toward the courts. It was my friend's father, who shouted to my friend that his baby had stopped breathing and was being rushed to the hospital. In a flash my friend was in the car and gone, disappearing in a cloud of dust.\nFor a moment I just stood there, paralyzed . Then I tried to figure out what I should do. Follow my friend to the hospital? There was nothing I could accomplish there, I convinced myself. My friend's son was in the care of doctors and nurses, and nothing I could do or say would affect the outcome. Be there for moral support? Well, maybe. But my friend and his wife both had large families, and I knew they'd be surrounded by relatives who would provide more than enough comfort and support, whatever happened. All I could do at the hospital, I decided, was to get in the way. Also, I had planned a full day with my family, who were waiting for me to get home. So I decided to head back to my house and check in my friend later.\nAs I started my car, I realized that my friend had left his truck and keys at the courts. I now faced another problem. I couldn't leave the keys in the truck. So I decided to go to the hospital and give him the keys.\nWhen I arrived, I was directed to a room where my friend and his wife were waiting. As I had thought, the room was filled with family members silently watching my friend comfort his wife. I went in and stood by the door, trying to decide what to do next. Soon a doctor appeared. He approached my friend and his wife, and in a quiet voice told them that their son had died.\nFor a long time the two held each other and cried, unaware of the rest of us standing around in pained silence. After they had calmed themselves, the doctor suggested they spend a few moments with their son.\nMy friend and his wife stood up and walked past their families. When they reached the door, my friend saw me standing in the corner. He came over and hugged me and started to cry. My friend's wife hugged me, too, and said , \"Thanks for being here.\"\nFor the rest of that morning, I sat in the emergency room of that hospital and watched my friend and his wife hold the body of their infant son, and say goodbye.\nIt's the most important thing I have ever done. The experience taught me two lessons.\nFirst: The most important thing I've ever done happened when I was completely helpless. None of the things I had learned in university, in three years of law school or in six years of legal practice were of any use in that situation. Something terrible was happening to people I cared about, and I was powerless to change the outcome. All I could do was standing by and watching it happen. And yet it was critical that I do just that--- just be there when someone needed me.\nSecond: The most important thing I've done almost didn't happen because of things I had learned in classroom and professional life. Law school taught me how to take a set of facts, break them down and organized them. These skills are critical for lawyers. When people come to us for help, they're often stressed out and depend on a lawyer to think logically. But while learning to think, I almost forget how to feel. Today I have no doubt that I should have leapt into my car without hesitation and followed my friend to the hospital.\nFrom that one experience I learned that the most important thing in life isn't the money you make, the status you attain or the honors you achieve.

Dr. Thomas Houston, a professor of the University of Massachusetts Medical School, led a group of scientists that investigated how pre-recorded videos of hypertension   patients' talking about their medical histories helped another group of patients with high blood pressure to control their condition over several months.\n   Houston was surprised by their studies that suggested that communication can be a powerful tool in medicine. They showed that those who had had similar experiences, when talking to someone with a similar background, could help change their behavior to become healthier. Hypertension is difficult to control, since it is dependent on diet, exercise and mental state. Medical treatments with drugs, and lifestyle therapies  have been  ly ineffective because people find it hard to follow those medical requirements.\n   In the test, his team carefully chose their story-tellers from 230 members of a patients' community with whom they could most easily relate. Next, they divided their study population into two groups. One received three interactive   DVDs containing the tellers' stories of their experiences in living with and treating their hypertension. The other were given educational discs on an unrelated health topic. The study volunteers reported that they had listened to the DVDs, and after three months, those who heard the stories of the hypertensive patients lowered their blood pressure.\n  While the study did not  _ how the story-telling influenced the patients' behavior, Houston suspects that watching patients of similar backgrounds who had a similar medical experience helped to motivate them to seek medical help to their hypertension. They found that after six months the difference in blood pressure between those who watched the story-tellers and those who observed the unrelated videos remained, suggesting that the story-telling continued to have an effect.

Then I remembered a man coming in out of the corner of my eye. He was dressed in mostly white, sat down at the bar, had a glass of wine, stayed for maybe ten minutes and then left. The waitress said, \"Yes, the gentleman who was in here a while ago paid for you.\"\nJust last year, I was running a half-marathon. With just 0.1 miles to go, I was out of gas.

Okay, Jennifer, let's go! Come on! It's just around the corner! You can do it!\". And he ran with me until I picked up my pace.

It was a string of earthquakes that made the small town shake all the time.This went on for more than a year.Sometimes the quakes were very small.Only certain instruments could pick them up.At other times, the quakes damaged houses and land.The people were always afraid.They wished they knew how to stop the ground from shaking.\nPeople all over the world would like to know when an earthquake is coming.But an earthquake is almost always a surprise.Under the surface of the Earth, huge blocks of rock drift apart or slide against each other.The ground above splits apart or rumbles and shakes.\nSome scientists hope to predict quakes by keeping a close watch on animals.It seems that some animals can sense an earthquake coming.In 1969, animals in a Chinese zoo began to act funny one day.Swans flew out of their pond.A panda sat down, covered its eyes with its paws, and groaned.The animals seemed to know that something was about to happen.And it did.An earthquake struck.What was it that the animals sensed? Scientists are trying to find out.\nKeeping close track of the Earth's magnetic force in earthquake areas may also help.A few years ago, in Hollister, CA, scientists kept a record of the area's magnetic pull.For one week, the force grew stronger.Then it weakened suddenly.A day later, an earthquake struck.\nIt may become possible to know when and where an earthquake will happen.But it will be much harder to stop one from happening.\nMany scientists think that the Earth's covering is not smooth.They say the earth's \"skin\" is made up of huge puzzle pieces called plates.Land and ocean floors make up these huge plates.Under the Earth's crust  , or plates, is hot rock.The plates float on top of this rock.Sometimes the rock forces its way through the crust.What happens then? A volcano is born! More often, the rock moves and forces the plates to pull away from each other, causing earthquakes to happen.(Volcanoes and earthquakes often go together.)\nSometimes, the plates end up on top of each other.When this happens, the land above may look strange.Seen from the air, there seems to be a long scar in the Earth.This is called a fault  .The areas along faults have more earthquakes than other parts of the Earth.\nFor now, we'll just have to shake along with the Earth.It goes through millions of small earthquakes every year.With luck, you won't feel a thing!

It was a string of earthquakes that made the small town shake all the time.This went on for more than a year.Sometimes the quakes were very small.Only certain instruments could pick them up.At other times, the quakes damaged houses and land.The people were always afraid.They wished they knew how to stop the ground from shaking.\nPeople all over the world would like to know when an earthquake is coming.But an earthquake is almost always a surprise.Under the surface of the Earth, huge blocks of rock drift apart or slide against each other.The ground above splits apart or rumbles and shakes.\nSome scientists hope to predict quakes by keeping a close watch on animals.It seems that some animals can sense an earthquake coming.In 1969, animals in a Chinese zoo began to act funny one day.Swans flew out of their pond.A panda sat down, covered its eyes with its paws, and groaned.The animals seemed to know that something was about to happen.And it did.An earthquake struck.What was it that the animals sensed? Scientists are trying to find out.\nKeeping close track of the Earth's magnetic force in earthquake areas may also help.A few years ago, in Hollister, CA, scientists kept a record of the area's magnetic pull.For one week, the force grew stronger.Then it weakened suddenly.A day later, an earthquake struck.\nIt may become possible to know when and where an earthquake will happen.But it will be much harder to stop one from happening.\nMany scientists think that the Earth's covering is not smooth.They say the earth's \"skin\" is made up of huge puzzle pieces called plates.Land and ocean floors make up these huge plates.Under the Earth's crust  , or plates, is hot rock.The plates float on top of this rock.Sometimes the rock forces its way through the crust.What happens then? A volcano is born! More often, the rock moves and forces the plates to pull away from each other, causing earthquakes to happen.(Volcanoes and earthquakes often go together.)\nSometimes, the plates end up on top of each other.When this happens, the land above may look strange.Seen from the air, there seems to be a long scar in the Earth.This is called a fault  .The areas along faults have more earthquakes than other parts of the Earth.\nFor now, we'll just have to shake along with the Earth.It goes through millions of small earthquakes every year.With luck, you won't feel a thing! Question: How does a fault form? Choices: 1. After volcano comes. OR 2. When the plates end up on top of each other. OR 3. Before an earthquake happens. OR 4. When California rests on two separate plates. Answer:\n", "Result": "2. When the plates end up on top of each other.", "GroundTruth": "2.

Mr McClellan and his wife took the teen in and helped him before he found a permanent solution. \n     When it came to his next step, David aimed high and applied for a list of top colleges, including the University of Pennsylvania, MIT, Princeton, Cornell, Yale, Harvard and Washington University in St. Louis. In the end, only MIT rejected his application and he was left to choose his own fate from the selective prestigious and mostly Ivy League schools. \nDavid's next challenge is to fight back tears at graduation this weekend. \"I promised myself I wouldn't cry. But I realize that's what everyone does before they cry. I'm pretty sure there's going to be a lot of emotion there.\" he said. Question: What's probably the best title for the passage? Choices: 1.

We mean that they're protected from too many worries and troubles, that they live in a settled home, probably surrounded by friends and family, and that they don't have to cope with the difficulties the world is full of alone.\nCertainly no one would say that this girl was leading a sheltered life; she's leaving home to earn her living in a strange city and live by herself in a bed sitter. She may be just as well protected physically as a \"sheltered life\" person, but she's lost all the other shelters in her life--family, friends, the home she grew up in, school, the groups she belonged to. She s on her own now and unless she's very self-reliant , she's likely to feel unhappy and insecure at times.\nA young person setting out on her own like this is between the two main kinds of shelter most of us spend our lives in. One is our parents home where we grow up, and the other is the home we make ourselves and where we bring up our own children. For most people the time they spend between or outside these two shelters is only a small part of their lives. Question: What would be best title for the passage? Choices: 1. Leaving Home OR 2.

So much more is to be learned outside school by the students themselves.\nIt is always more important to know how to study by oneself than to learn some facts or a formula by heart. It is actually quite easy to learn a certain fact in history or a formula  in mathematics. But it is very difficult to use a formula in working out a maths problem. Great scientist, such as Einstein, Newton and Galileo, didn't get everything from school. But they were all so successful and invented so many things for men. They worked hard all their lives, wasting not a single moment. They would ask many questions as they read and they did thousands of experiments. Question: What's the good advice the writer gives us?

But we saw little progress in David no matter what we tried with him. Five days into the eight-day session saw a quiet, sad little pirate.\n Then something happened on that fifth night. Something at camp that we would call \"huge\". \nIt was cabin night. That's the time when campers and counselors spend lime together in each individual cabin instead of an all-camp activity. Campers love cabin nights because there's always a bedtime snack. On the cabin table that night were bags of potato chips.\nDavid slowly walked over to the table, leaving his comer to join the rest of us. He took one of the bags of the potato chips and started smashing  it with his little fists, as all the other campers looked on in disbelief, I wondered what the cabin counselor would do.\nThe college-age volunteer counselor positioned a bag of chips on die table in front of himself, and he, too, started smashing it with his fist. The campers went crazy as everyone ran to the table to get in on the fun of smashing potato chips with their fists.\nSomehow everyone knew, everyone sensed, that anger within him was now being released. \nFor the last couple days of the session, David was a different kid. He was a little nine-year-old boy again, trying to fill the hours of each remaining day at camp with as much fun as could be possible.\nSeveral days after the session, David came back again. This time, there wasn't anything he wouldn't try to fit in to his day. He sure was having a great time at camp. David asked me if I needed an altar boy when I celebrated Mass in the woods. Sure enough, he was my altar boy. I remembered how carefully he listened to me when I talked about death. 1 said it's only a doorway. You walk through the door and there's the Lord God and behind God a whole line of people waiting to hug you.\nAfter Mass, he said to me, \"Hey Fatha, a door, huh?\"\nA couple more days of fun passed and tonight was the talent show. The tradition is that campers and counselors dress up in costumes, and everyone gets a standing applause for singing and dancing or simply just acting like fools on stage.\n The show had begun: lights, camera, action.\nUnfortunately, the only action taking place in our row of seats was little David making his way from counselor to counselor to say an early good-bye to camp. He had become quite ill and had to go to the hospital because of this new crisis.\nWhen this little nine-year-old pirate stood in front of me, he gave me a hug and a big wet kiss on my cheek. 1 was crying.

Ironically, some such stores, including clothing labels Urban Outfitters and American Apparel, have gained mainstream popularity. This has seemingly diluted  the anti-mainstream culture.\n\"A lot of people that are self-defined hipsters aren't really hipsters, they're just trying to conform to the non-conformist  to seem cooler,\" says Amanda Leopold, a college student from Oberlin College, US. Although Leopold has many unconventional tastes and seems quite individualist, she refuses to classify herself as a hipster.\nThere is a conflict among hipsters about the very definition of the label. To some, to be a hipster is to be free from cultural constraints. To others, it means wearing a certain style and listening to a specific style of music. The former constantly strives for uniqueness, while the latter strives not to be mainstream.\nAnd yet, the movement is gaining mainstream popularity. \"It's kind of the trend these days; _ \" says Leopold. \"There have been hipsters since the seventies. It's only become popular recently.\"\nHipsters reject materialism and laugh at mainstream culture. But are they really beyond material comforts? Do they have any ideas of their own if they despise mainstream so much?\nChristy Wampole, an associate professor of literature at Princeton University, US, is not so sure. She says the hipster is a contradiction in himself and an easy target of mockery . Writing in The New York Times, Wampole paints a less appreciative picture of a typical hipster.\n\"The hipster is a scholar of social forms, a student of cool. He studies continuously, searching for what has yet to be found by the mainstream. He is a walking citation ; his clothes refer to much more than themselves. He tries to negotiate the age-old problem of individuality, not with concepts, but with material things.\" Question: The passage mainly tells us   _  .

Online learning is much less complicated than it seems. Students can learn at any time, anywhere, at any speed.

The traditional classroom model for education and learning is hard to leave behind. Because humans are social creatures, there're times when we need to see each other face-to-face for interactive learning. A social and personal connection often builds effective teams, solves problems, and inspires confidence. So one possible solution is to combine online learning with the old traditional classroom learning , which not only makes the learning process faster and cheaper, but also highlights the interactions between teachers and students.\nThe bottom line: the Internet is the most important educational tool in the information age and online learning will become a main part of every individual's learning experience in the future.

Some examples:\nKeep kitchen counters clear. No visible snack food, no bread, no nuts--not even breakfast cereal. In Wansink's research, \"women who had even one box of breakfast cereal that was visible-anywhere in their kitchen--weighed 21 pounds more than their neighbor who didn't.\"\nTrick yourself into drinking less wine. \"We tend to focus on the height of what we pour and not the width, so we pour 12 percent less wine into taller wineglasses than we pour into wider wineglasses.\" And the shape of the glass is not the only variable that affects how much we drink.

In the mid-2000s he famously coined the phrase \"mindless eating\"(and wrote a book by that name) to focus attention on all the bad dietary decisions we make without really thinking about them.\nHis new book, Slim by Design: Mindless Eating Solutions for Everyday Life, aims to change the design of restaurants, school lunchrooms, office cafeterias and homes so that the mindless choices we make will be more healthful ones. Some examples:\nKeep kitchen counters clear. No visible snack food, no bread, no nuts--not even breakfast cereal. In Wansink's research, \"women who had even one box of breakfast cereal that was visible-anywhere in their kitchen--weighed 21 pounds more than their neighbor who didn't.\"\nTrick yourself into drinking less wine. \"We tend to focus on the height of what we pour and not the width, so we pour 12 percent less wine into taller wineglasses than we pour into wider wineglasses.\" And the shape of the glass is not the only variable that affects how much we drink. Wansink writes: \"Because red wine is easier to see than white wine, we pour 9 percent less red wine whenever we pour a glass.\"\nWansink said his researchers also found that people ate less at restaurants when sat in well-lighted areas near windows and doors, than in darker areas or in the back. They ate less if they were offered a doggie bag, or to-go box, before they got their meals: apparently the idea of getting a \"free\" second meal outweighed the impulse  to clean their plates. Workers who frequently ate at their desks weighed 15.4 pounds less, on average, than those who didn't. Fruits and vegetables kept on the top shelf of the refrigerator were eaten at higher rates than those on lower shelves.\nThe point, Wansink says, is to consider findings like those and change your environment or habits. Then you won't have to think about it: You'll just eat less. Question: What's the main idea of the passage? Choices: 1. Changing environment or habits of eating will help you eat less. OR 2. Keeping your kitchen counter clear of any food will help make you thin. OR 3. Eating fruits and vegetables is better for your health. OR 4. Many people eat or drink too much without paying attention to it. Answer:\n", "Result": "1. Changing environment or habits of eating will help you eat less.", "GroundTruth": "1.

In medicine as in law, government, and other lines of work, the requirements of honesty often seem dwarfed   by greater needs: the need to protect from brutal news or to uphold a promise of secrecy; to advance the public interest.\nWhat should doctors say, for example, to a 46-year-old man coming in for a routine physical check up just before going on vacation with his family who, though he feels in perfect health, is found to have a form of cancer that will cause him to die within six months.

With time and effort he located her address. She lived in New York City. He wrote her a letter introducing himself and inviting her to correspond. The next day he was shipped overseas for service in World War II.\nDuring the next year and one month the two grew to know each other through the mail. Each letter was a seed falling on a fertile heart. A romance was starting Blanchard requested a photograph, but she refused. She felt that if he really cared, it wouldn't matter what she looked like.\nWhen the day finally came for him to return from Europe, they scheduled their first meeting --7:00 PM at the Grand Central Station in New York. \"You'll recognize me,\" she wrote, \"by the red rose I'll be wearing on my lapel.\" So at 7:00 he was in the station looking for a girl whose heart he loved, but whose face he'd never seen.\nI'll let Mr. Blanchard tell you what happened: A young woman was coming toward me, her figure long and slim. Her blonde hair lay back in curls from her delicate ears; her eyes were blue as flowers. Her lips and chin had a gentle firmness, and in her pale green suit she was like springtime come alive. I stared at her, entirely forgetting to notice that she was not wearing a rose. As I moved, a small, attractive smile curved her lips. \"Going my way , sailor?\" she murmured.\nAlmost uncontrollably I made one step closer to her, and then I saw Hollis Maynell. She was standing almost directly behind the girl. A woman well past 40, she had graying hair tucked under a worn hat. She was more than plump, her thick-ankled feet thrust into low-heeled shoes. The girl in the green suit was walking quickly away. I felt as though I was split in two, so keen was my desire to follow her, and yet so deep was my longing for the woman whose spirit had truly companioned me and upheld my own.\nAnd there she stood. Her pale, plump face was gentle and sensible, her gray eyes had a warm and kindly twinkle. I did not hesitate. My fingers gripped the small worn blue leather copy of the book that was to identify me to her.\nThis would not be love, but it would be something precious, something perhaps even better than love, a friendship for which I had been and must ever be grateful. I squared my shoulders and saluted and held out the book to the woman, even though while I spoke I felt choked by the bitterness of my disappointment.  \"I'm Lieutenant John Blanchard, and you must be Miss Maynell. I am so glad you could meet me; may I take you to dinner?\"\nThe woman's face broadened into a tolerant smile. \"I don't know what this is about, son,\" she answered, \"but the young lady in the green suit who just went by, she begged me to wear this rose on my coat.

Her blonde hair lay back in curls from her delicate ears; her eyes were blue as flowers. Her lips and chin had a gentle firmness, and in her pale green suit she was like springtime come alive. I stared at her, entirely forgetting to notice that she was not wearing a rose. As I moved, a small, attractive smile curved her lips. \"Going my way , sailor?\" she murmured.\nAlmost uncontrollably I made one step closer to her, and then I saw Hollis Maynell. She was standing almost directly behind the girl. A woman well past 40, she had graying hair tucked under a worn hat. She was more than plump, her thick-ankled feet thrust into low-heeled shoes. The girl in the green suit was walking quickly away. I felt as though I was split in two, so keen was my desire to follow her, and yet so deep was my longing for the woman whose spirit had truly companioned me and upheld my own.\nAnd there she stood. Her pale, plump face was gentle and sensible, her gray eyes had a warm and kindly twinkle. I did not hesitate. My fingers gripped the small worn blue leather copy of the book that was to identify me to her.\nThis would not be love, but it would be something precious, something perhaps even better than love, a friendship for which I had been and must ever be grateful. I squared my shoulders and saluted and held out the book to the woman, even though while I spoke I felt choked by the bitterness of my disappointment.  \"I'm Lieutenant John Blanchard, and you must be Miss Maynell. I am so glad you could meet me; may I take you to dinner?\"\nThe woman's face broadened into a tolerant smile. \"I don't know what this is about, son,\" she answered, \"but the young lady in the green suit who just went by, she begged me to wear this rose on my coat. And she said if you were to ask me out to dinner, I should go and tell you that she is waiting for you in the big restaurant across the street. She said it was some kind of test!\"\nIt's not difficult to understand and admire Miss Maynell's wisdom.

That day, the supermarket can be as crowded as a department store at Christmas. And this Easter, on top of my regular checklist, I had to buy the ingredient  for a delicious, new recipe I'd discovered: sliced ham and turkey layered with Swiss cheese and cabbage, all wrapped in pastry dough.\nTrouble was that my work schedule had left me no time to shop earlier in the week. I would get up extra early and take care of everything on Saturday morning, I thought, as I drove to the office on Friday. But that morning, Yola, one of my co-workers, asked if my husband Robert and I would help her move the next day. \"I really don't have anybody else to ask,\" she apologized.\n\"Sure,\" I told her, soft touch that I am. Early Saturday morning, Robert, my 15-year-old son Ben, and I drove our truck to her old apartment. Oh, the piles of furniture and boxes! It took us till late afternoon to get her settled in her new place.\nBy the time we returned home, I was exhausted. I don't know how I'm going to go shopping now, let alone cook Easter dinner, I thought. The only ingredient I had at home was the cabbage. On the kitchen counter were two shopping bags of food that Yola had sent home with us -- her thanks for helping her move. She was leaving on a trip the next day, and didn't want the food to go to waste.\nI reached into the first bag and pulled out a package of sliced ham. Well, that's lucky, I thought. Then I pulled out a package of sliced turkey, and another of Swiss cheese. That's strange, I thought. There's no way Yola knew my Easter dinner plans. I reached back into the grocery bag, thinking of the Easter miracle. All of a sudden, the strangest feeling came over me. I lifted it out.

And this Easter, on top of my regular checklist, I had to buy the ingredient  for a delicious, new recipe I'd discovered: sliced ham and turkey layered with Swiss cheese and cabbage, all wrapped in pastry dough.\nTrouble was that my work schedule had left me no time to shop earlier in the week. I would get up extra early and take care of everything on Saturday morning, I thought, as I drove to the office on Friday. But that morning, Yola, one of my co-workers, asked if my husband Robert and I would help her move the next day. \"I really don't have anybody else to ask,\" she apologized.\n\"Sure,\" I told her, soft touch that I am. Early Saturday morning, Robert, my 15-year-old son Ben, and I drove our truck to her old apartment. Oh, the piles of furniture and boxes! It took us till late afternoon to get her settled in her new place.\nBy the time we returned home, I was exhausted. I don't know how I'm going to go shopping now, let alone cook Easter dinner, I thought. The only ingredient I had at home was the cabbage. On the kitchen counter were two shopping bags of food that Yola had sent home with us -- her thanks for helping her move. She was leaving on a trip the next day, and didn't want the food to go to waste.\nI reached into the first bag and pulled out a package of sliced ham. Well, that's lucky, I thought.

Here is a list of practical steps you can take to prepare and protect yourself and your family.\n1) Know the symptoms-- Here are some of the symptoms that sound like swine flu -- fevers over 100 degrees (37.8degC), body aches, cough, runny nose, and sometimes, nausea   and diarrhea  . It's also useful to know if you might have had an exposure   either by recent travel to Mexico, or to the areas of known cases so far in America -- specific areas of California, Texas, New York, Ohio and Kansas. Or you may have been exposed to a sick person who came from those areas. \n2) Don't panic-- If you have symptoms that sound like swine flu, do not rush to hospitals. Not only is this difficult for the healthcare system, it can also be potentially dangerous for everyone. Call your doctor or local public health clinic before going in.\n3) Contain the illness-- Hand-washing works. Wash, wash and wash. Invest in some hand sanitizer   for the whole family. Avoid hugs and kisses of well-wishers, and do not share telephone handsets or computers. Be especially careful to always cough into the elbow of your arm (yes! the elbow, not your hand!). Cover your cough and sneeze to protect others. \n4) What about a mask?-- The data shows that masks do work --as long asthere is a tight seal   about the mouth and nose. \n5) Eat the pork(if you want) -- Swine flu gets its name because pigs can get the infection and spread it to each other -- as well as to humans. This latest virus contains pieces that indicate it evolved   from swine flu virus, and can now spread from person to person. Swine flu is not spread by properly prepared and cooked pork products. So if you want to eat pork, you can.\n6) Getting sick? Stay home!-- In our go-go-go culture and these severe economic times, it can be very hard to call a boss and cancel a day's work. Now, however, if you or your loved ones are feeling like there's a flu coming on, stay home.\n7) Stockpile?-- Right now, it's too early for any of us to become a Swine Flu Shut-In, but the public health department recommends that each home have two weeks of supplies, in case we must stay home -- either for illness or to help contain transmission. That means two weeks of food for everyone in your home, two weeks of all medications, and, if you're like most people, two weeks of books and DVDs.

It is necessary for understanding other disciplines.  Only philosophy questions the nature of the concepts used in a discipline, and its relation to other disciplines. And through the study of philosophy, one develops sound methods of research and analysis that can be applied to any field.\nThere are a number of general uses of philosophy. It strengthens one's ability to solve problems, to communicate, to organize ideas and issues, to persuade, and to take what is the most important from a large quantity of data.These general uses are of great benefit in the career field, not necessarily for obtaining one's first job after graduation, but for preparing for positions of responsibility, management and leadership later on. It is very short-sighted after all, to take a course of studies only for the purpose of getting one's first job. The useful skills developed through the study of philosophy have significant long-term benefits in career advancement. No other discipline systematically follows the ideals of wisdom, leadership, and capacity to resolve human conflict. Question: From the passage, we can conclude  _  .

But if you want to save a little water and reuse it on your lawns or plants --- or even use it for laundry, dishes, or other needs --- collecting rainwater from your gutter's downspouts  is a _ \nAccording to John C. Davis, writing in E / The Environmental Magazine, just about any homeowner can collect rainwater, given that the roof and gutters do most of the work. And since an inch of rain falling on a 2,000-square-foot roof produces some 1,200 gallons of water, you can harvest enough to water your lawn or garden.\nPlants and grass actually do better when fed rainwater instead of tap water, which is usually treated with substances that can hold back plant growth. Using rainwater can also extend the life of pipes, since the salts added to tap water may gradually damage the pipes. However, homeowners should set up a water purification system if they do plan to use rainwater for inside needs.\nRainwater harvesting can also be good for the local community, as it reduces the erosion, flooding, and pollution associated with heavy rainfall, and reduces dependence on public water supplies. So some states fund rainwater collection systems in their local communities.\nMany varieties of rain barrel  systems, starting at just $100, are available for home use. A typical setup is simply a rain barrel positioned under a gutter's downspout. Skillful homeowners can make their own water harvesting systems, but buying one is a lot easier.

Each term I paid my tuition fees in one payment, but I also received my loan for living costs in one payment. It was up to me to organize how I would spend this. \nI divided the amount to calculate my weekly budget and it was important that I tried not to overspend. I had to be disciplined and keep a close eye on my expenditure. Food, clothes and going out are the main things students spend money on. \nWith a loan, students have total financial freedom. Instead of having someone looking over their shoulder, they must make every financial decision for themselves. \nThis year, university fees were tripled.

Have you ever wondered what it would be like if you could spend more time on your hobby and less time at work? Maybe it's not an either/or situation. Perhaps you can do both at the same time.\nWhen choosing a career, one of the things you must consider is your interests. Why then do so many people not even think about their hobbies when a hobby is, in fact, an interest? Perhaps it's because even Webster's Dictionary defines a hobby as \"a pursuit (,) outside one's regular occupation  \". Maybe this is a rule you should break. After all, no one ever said your hobby had to stay separate from your occupation. In addition people are usually very skilled at their hobbies. The combination of interest and skill is a very compelling   reason to choose a particular career.\n\"Who's going to hire someone who loves making beaded   jewelry?\" you may ask yourself. Good question. Don't wait for someone to hire you. Start your own business. That may be the best way to combine your hobby with your career. Those with hobbies that involve creating things, i.e. jewelry, clothing, or pottery, may do well to sell those items on their own. Before you go forward with your plans, though, you should find out whether being an entrepreneur   is for you.\nWhen you attempt to turn your hobby into a career, don't forget to do your homework. Even though you may have enjoyed training your pet birds to sing the national song, that doesn't mean you're suitable to be an animal trainer. Be sure to research your career choice completely.

Hopefully some of them will allow even more families to get health insurance.\nThe Healthy Families Program is made to help those who don't have welfare   and cannot earn enough to pay for private health insurance. It is an important program, but officials say that too many people are signing up for it and then dropping out   because of the Healthy Families Program's cost.

The last thing he remembers seeing was his daughter being born 13 years ago. Then the world went blank; he can only imagine what his only child looks like now, as a teenaged honor student. Bad luck is no stranger to this warm and thoughtful 37-year-old man. His mother died of cancer when he was 4, and his father, who was often ill, had to give him up to the care of the state when he was 11. He later worked for 19 years in a workshop making household goods, deathly boring work. Earlier this month, Alberto Torres's wife, who had just been laid off from her job, had to have a breast removed due to cancer and now faces a year of radiation treatments. Things seemed always to go from almost incredibly bad to worse. Even Mr. Torres's good luck has a dark side: Five years ago, his lovely guide dog pulled him out of the path of a truck. Mr. Torres was not hurt. The dog was killed.\nBut Mr. Torres does not feel sorry for himself. \"These are just little bumps you have to go over in your life,\" he said.

He would then ride the R train to 59th Street where he would walk upstairs to switch to the Number 6 train. At one point along the journey, he might chat with a stranger. At another, someone would pat his dog, calling him by name. People offered assistance, even seats. At 125th Street, Mr. Torres would transfer to the Number 4 train by crossing the platform.

In one of the most extensive reports on college drinking thus far, a 1997 Harvard School of Public Health study found that 43 percent of college students admitted binge drinking in the preceding two weeks (Defined as four drinks in a sitting for a woman and five of a man, a drinking binge is when one drinks enough to risk health and well - being )\nExperts estimate that excessive drinking is involved in thousands of student deaths a year. And the Harvard researchers found that there has been a dramatic change in why students drink. 39 percent drank \"to get drunk\" in 1993, but 52 percent had the same objective in 1997.\n\"What has changed is the across - the - board acceptability of intoxication  ,\" says Felix Savino at UW - Madison. Many college students today see not just drinking but being drunk as their primary way of socializing.\nThe reasons for the shift are complex and not fully understood. But researchers guess that it may have something to do with today's instant - satisfaction life - style--and young people tend to take into the extreme.\nWhile binge drinking isn't always deadly, it does have other, wide - ranging effects. Academics is one area where it takes a heavy  _ (something paid, lost or suffered). Perhaps because alcohol increases aggression and affects judgement, it is also related to 25 percent of violent crimes and roughly 60 percent of vandalism on campus. Facing the many potential dangers, college campuses are searching for ways to reduce binge drinking. Question: Students regard drinking and binge drinking as_.

Anger and negative energy have a strong influence on everyone's life, even when they don't realize it.\nBeing in a calm state of mind is simply wonderful. Results of this can be seen when parents no longer shout at their children over any small thing and when one can keep him cool when bad things happen and doesn't let the situation become worse by his negative influence.\nAlso results can be seen on a larger scale. In 1993 a very interesting scientific experiment called The US Transcendental Meditation experiment was conducted in Washington. A company called TM got 4,000 calm and relaxed people to simply sit and meditate   in a central Washington convention center. The results of this experiment showed that during those particular 8 weeks, violent crimes, such as murder, rape, assaults, clearly decreased by as much as 23%.\nThis is evident proof that meditation can change the state of mind, bring back peace of mind and collective meditation is contagious  , just as anything done collectively is contagious. For example, a person has the urge to become aggressive (while in normal circumstances that person is very calm and normal), just because he is sitting at a stadium watching a football game and everyone around is shouting and is aggressive.\nIsn't increasing the quality of life worth spending 20 minutes of time on meditation? Yes, very few people follow through with a meditation method that should be a joy to do. Many start and leave it after only a few sessions.\nSo if collective meditation has proven that meditation works, that it calms people down and that it brings their levels of stress down, why not employ it in everyday life?

I took courses in weather science at Eastern Kentucky University, but I majored in broadcasting news.\nHow did you finally become a weatherman?\nMy first job in the early 1980s was at the local TV station in Paducah, Kentucky. I did everything from turning on the lights in the morning to writing and delivering morning news. I put together weather forecasts, and became interested in them.\nBack then, how did you forecast weather?\nIndependent companies collected computer information that showed, for example, how a single weather system might split into snow or snow mixed with rain. The information was often opposite and the job of a weatherman was to study the information and make the best educated guess about the storm.\nHas weather forecasting changed much with new technology?\nAdvanced computers, satellites, and Doppler radar (sound waves used to track storms) have made forecasting more exact. But we still know very little about how weather is shaped. So far, we just have theories.\nAny advice for children who'd like to become weather scientists?\nTo me, weather is the most exciting field in the world. There are still so many more questions about weather than answers. After all, if we can't foresee floods or hurricanes, how safe a society are we?

Since all activities remain interesting for only so long, too much homework can lead to ennui. So, why are some kids getting homework overload? Teachers give two reasons. First, they say, the government now requires schools to meet higher-than-ever achievement goals for students. If students don' t succeed, the school faces punishment. Second, many parents want their children to be able to get into the best colleges and universities. These parents believe homework is a way to ensure that students are learning as much as possible.\nPeople who favor homework argue that it can have many beneficial effects. They claim it can help students develop good study habits. Homework can help students recognize that learning can occur at home as well as at school. It can help develop their independent learning and responsible character traits .\nBut studies show that middle school students doing 60 to 90 minutes of homework a night are doing just as well in school as those doing more than 90 minutes. And homework can have negative effects. Homework can deny students access to leisure  activities that also teach important skills. For example, sports teams teach cooperation and leadership, in addition to helping kids stay physically active. Another problem with too much homework is that parents can get too involved. They can put too much pressure on their kids.\nSo what should be done? Good homework assignments in the proper amount will have positive effects.

It can help develop their independent learning and responsible character traits .\nBut studies show that middle school students doing 60 to 90 minutes of homework a night are doing just as well in school as those doing more than 90 minutes. And homework can have negative effects. Homework can deny students access to leisure  activities that also teach important skills. For example, sports teams teach cooperation and leadership, in addition to helping kids stay physically active. Another problem with too much homework is that parents can get too involved. They can put too much pressure on their kids.\nSo what should be done? Good homework assignments in the proper amount will have positive effects. Too much homework, however, will have negative effects. The bottom line: Students in grades three through six should do no more than 30 to 60 minutes of homework each night.

Since all activities remain interesting for only so long, too much homework can lead to ennui. So, why are some kids getting homework overload? Teachers give two reasons. First, they say, the government now requires schools to meet higher-than-ever achievement goals for students. If students don' t succeed, the school faces punishment. Second, many parents want their children to be able to get into the best colleges and universities.

You might not think so, but people in China eat on average   about 12 grams of salt each day, that is much higher than the 6 grams suggested by the World Health Organization. You could be eating too much without realizing it, because about 75% of the salt we eat is already in the food we buy, such as bread, sauces, soups and sausages.\nWhat problems can eating too much salt cause? To answer that question, first let's take a look at what salt is.\nSalt is a chemical compound. It is made of sodium   and chloride  . Salt is used to keep and flavor foods. A small amount of salt is important for good health because our bodies need sodium and chloride to work.\nBut past studies have found that people who eat more salt than they need tend to have high blood pressure. Eating too much salt has also been connected with other conditions, such as heart and kidney   problems.\nIf you want to cut down on salt, the good news is, there are plenty of simple things to do. Here are some tips:\n*Cut back on high salt foods.\nMost foods contain some salt. But some foods such as cheese, bacon, pickles  , smoked fish and chips are almost always high in salt because of the way they are made. You can still enjoy them, but try to have these in smaller amounts, or eat them less often.\n*Choose reduced salt bread and breakfast cereals.\nBread and breakfast cereals   are major source of salt in the diet, not that they're necessarily high in salt but because we eat a lot of them. For these foods, there can be a really big difference between different types and brands. So next time you're shopping, take the time to compare the salt levels on a few similar products.

Researchers also found that some individuals of normal body weight have an increased risk of the disease.\nBeing overweight does increase your risk of medical problems, but the studies found that not all heavy people are less healthy than thin people.\nIn one study, American researchers examined medical records from over 5000 men and women. Each person had taken part in a separate study from 1999 to 2004. The searchers found that about 51% of them were overweight or obese. About 32% were obese, but considered metabolically healthy. This means they had no evidence of problems in tests for high blood pressure or other factors linked to heart disease. However, more than 23% of people who were at a healthy weight were unhealthy in two or more aspects Judith WylieRosett helped carry out the American study. She says the finding show that all obese person can still be healthy. She believes that having body fat is not as important as where the fat is found on body. It's reported that twothirds of Americans are considered overweight or obese.\nA second study is suggesting that fat in the liver may be an important health risk. Norbert Stefan and his team closely examined 314 people.They measured how much body fat each person had, and where it was on the body. To do this ,they used medical imaging tests. They discovered that obese people could have healthy hearts. Their results suggest that fat in the liver is more dangerous than fat in other areas.\nThe results of both studies were published recently in the Archives of Internal Medicine.Professor WylieRosett says the findings don't mean that people shouldn't be concerned about obesity.  Experts say there are several diseases linked to obesity that make it more dangerous to be fat than thin. They say people should see their doctor to learn what health risks they may be facing and what behaviours should be changed to improve health.

Donald Lubeck was lying in bed. Outside, lightning lit up the sky, and thunder shook the house. Suddenly he heard the smoke alarm sounding. Lubeck walked down to see what happened; he opened the door to the kitchen, and flames  just went out.

Lubeck went back to his bedroom to call 911. \"I felt safe because the room had a separate stairway,\" he explains. The phone didn't work, and when Lubeck tried to go down the stairway, he was stopped by a wall of flames. Lubeck realized he was in trouble.

He rushed out, and headed towards Lubeck's house. He knew Lubeck lived in the house. He dialed 911.

While I grew up, it always made me sad to see so many of my friends and neighbors without a father or father-like figure around. This helped me appreciate how my father always takes an interest in his children's lives. In every aspect of my life, my father continuously pushes me to _ , so I could finish my work excellently among my people. Whenever I feel like giving up, or have a question or a concern, I know I can always turn to him for advice. From him I have also learned that sometimes _ . His strength seems to be unbreakable during hard times, and he is extremely determined to do anything he sets his mind on, no matter how small it is. I highly respect him for how he stands up for what he believes in, and will never back down. I have always admired his open mind, sympathy for people, and sense of understanding. He is a very strict man, but in our daily life, he has a great sense of humor, and always knows how to put a smile on the faces of his wife, his children and his friends.\nLiving in his love and instruction, I am very proud of my father. He also professes how proud he is of his children, and is still there to support us in whatever we are doing in. Question: What can we infer  about the author? Choices: 1.

Sometimes it is easy to see, like when your science teacher does a big experiment in class. At other times, it can be pretty hard to see everyday chemistry at work, but nearly everything you touch or use has some element of chemistry in it.\nSomething as simple as toothpaste contains at least three chemicals, if not more. It is the mixture of them and its chemical reaction that keeps your teeth clean. Other things you use every day are created by chemistry, such as hair products, shampoo and soap. Adding detergent   to water involves chemistry. Without chemistry, we would never have known that we need soap to get the oil out of clothes or skin. Chemistry not only helps us make products for use, but it also helps us understand the world around us. Chemistry helps us understand what the ozone layer   is and how it protects us.\nChemistry also gives us sunscreen to protect us from the sun. Thanks to chemistry, we know bleach   can't be mixed with vinegar, because it can produce _ gas. Without chemistry, we wouldn't have fireworks displays on important days.\nChemistry plays a big role in food preparation. Cooking food causes it to go through a chemical change.

Microblogs \"allow users to exchange small elements of content such as short sentences, individual images, or video links\".\nAs with traditional blogging, microbloggers post about topics ranging from the simple, such as \"what I'm doing right now,\" to the thematic , such as \"sports cars.\" Commercial microblogs also exist, to promote   websites, services and/or products, and to promote collaboration within an organization.\nSome microblogging services offer features such as privacy settings, which allow users to control who can read their microblogs, or other ways of publishing rights besides entering the web-based interface.  These may include text messaging, E-mail, or digital audio.\nThe first microblogs were known as tumblelogs. The term was invented in a blog post on April 12, 2005. However, by 2006 and 2007, the term microblog came into greater usage for such services provided by Tumbler and Twitter. Other leading social networking websites Facebook, MySpace, LinkedIn, and XING also have their own microblogging features, better known as status updates.\nSeveral studies, especially by Harvard Business School have tried to analyze the usage behavior of Microblogging services. Many of these studies show that for services such as Twitter, there is a small group of active users contributing to most of the activity.\nTwitter, Facebook and other microblogging services are also becoming a platform for marketing and public relations, with a sharp growth in the number of social media marketers. The Sysomos study shows that this specific group of marketers on Twitter is much more active than general user population, with 15% following more than 2,000 people.
