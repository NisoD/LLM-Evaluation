Choices: a. State responses to transnational crime have evolved in correlation to the increased threat posed to the integrity of the state. Organized crime has been regarded primarily as a national security threat to be addressed domestically. The institutionalized international approaches for information sharing have been predominately bilateral to the extent of bringing to justice perpetrators of crime that are seeking to evade justice. | b.

Possession of WMD may act as a deterrence to stronger opponents against potential threat, or be used to defeat their adversaries if engaged in combat. WMD capabilities may also be developed to gain automatic status and diplomatic influence amongst the international community. | b.

Choices: a. It is possible to study military security through non-realist analytical lenses, and to adopt a social constructivist approach that regards cultural and social factors as being important focuses of study. This has led to claims that broader approaches to military endeavours should be adopted, including the proposed employment of social and development specialists in conflict situations. | b. Social constructivists reject the foundations of realism upon which military security studies are based; in rejecting the empirical basis of security studies, the social constructivist approach becomes inadequate in its attempts to formulate military security theory. | c. Social constructivism is based on philosophical ideas that directly contradict the foundations of military-centred theory. The tendency is for social constructivists to dismiss military endeavours as clumsy and as being detrimental to human security. | d.

Choices: a. Transnational crime is regarded as a threat to economic development. Organized crime is seen as a threat to development insofar as it undermines the rule of law and deters foreign investment by increasing the level of insecurity in the host communities. Additionally, criminals often reinvest their proceeds in the legal economy and have unfair advantage through access to cheap capital and their ability to intimidate commercial adversaries. In societies with high levels of TNC, legitimate investors are often reluctant to commit resources. | b. TNC undermines democratic stability. In many states, transnational criminal enterprises have taken advantage of the instability that has accompanied the democratic transitions to post communist societies, using their influence in the upper reaches of the state and thus shielding themselves from law enforcement. The corruption of public institutions and the perceived inefficacy of the rule of law in new democracies contribute to undermining public confidence in and loyalty to the new regime. | c. The ability of transnational crime to evade state border controls and provide new avenues for the illicit transportation of goods and persons challenges the state's ability to exercise its core functions as guarantor of national sovereignty, the monopolization over the control of force, and as the provider of the common good. TNC criminal activities corrupt and undermine numerous state agencies, providing mechanisms by which their activities can affect the very nature of government and state policy in the host countries. | d.

Choices: a. A fusion weapon is a three-stage-bomb that uses an implosion device to create a fission reaction, which then detonates a fusion reaction. It is often referred to as a thermo-nuclear or hydrogen device and has unlimited destructive potential. | b. A fusion reaction is created when the nuclei of two light elements are combined, the reaction resulting in heavier elements fragmenting into smaller parts. This fragmentation releases energy of limited destructive capacity, the extent of energy released dependent on the mass of material used. | c. A fusion device is a two-stage process where a gun-type device is used to trigger a series of fission reactions with the cumulative result being the production of a high energy flash explosion with unlimited thermal energy. | d. Fusion weapons have a highly specific destructive effect. The heavier element produced from a fissions reaction, and the difference in mass from the two lighter nuclei (which is translated into an energy explosion) can be precision calculated.
