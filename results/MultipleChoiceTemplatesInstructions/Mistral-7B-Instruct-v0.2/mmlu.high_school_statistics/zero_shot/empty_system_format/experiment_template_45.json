The analysis will include a significance test with H0: Heartaid and the current medication are equally effective at preventing heart disease and HA: Heartaid is more effective than the current medication at preventing heart disease. Which of these would be a potential consequence of a Type II error? Answers: I. Doctors will begin to prescribe Heartaid to patients, even though it is actually not any more effective than the current medication.\nII.
