The bar cannot accelerate translationally or rotationally.\nc. The net torque will be zero if F1 and F2 are applied at the same point.\nd. The bar can accelerate translationally if F1 and F2 are not applied at the same point. Answer:\nc. The net torque will be zero if F1 and F2 are applied at the same point.\n\nQuestion: [question] Choices: [choices] Answer: [answer]\nQuestion: A pair of protective headphones reduces the sound of a jet engine from 140 dB to 110 dB.

What is a reasonable explanation for this observation? Choices: a. Sound is a mechanical wave that can change direction in its propagation media.\nb. Light is an electromagnetic wave that is behaving as a particle.\nc. Sound has a longer wavelength, which increases the diffraction.\nd. Light travels at 3 \u00d7 10^8 m/s, which is too fast to change direction around a corner. Answer:\nc.
