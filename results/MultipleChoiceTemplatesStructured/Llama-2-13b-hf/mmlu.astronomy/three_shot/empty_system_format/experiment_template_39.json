Opportunity may not be able to move its arm again; Spirit may not get enough solar power during the winter months immediately ahead.\n\nQuestion: [question] Choices: [choices] Answer: [answer]\nQuestion: The Coriolis effect is observed on planets because Choices: 1. the solar wind interacts with their magnetospheres OR 2. they rotate and have magnetic fields OR 3. their surfaces rotate at the same speed (meters/second) at all latitudes OR 4. they are rotating and spherical so different latitudes rotate at different speeds (meters/second) Answer:\n4. they are rotating and spherical so different latitudes rotate at different speeds (meters/second)\n\nQuestion: [question] Choices: [choices] Answer: [answer]\nQuestion: Why doesn't Venus have seasons like Mars and Earth do? Choices: 1. It is too close to the Sun. OR 2. Its rotation axis is nearly perpendicular to the plane of the Solar System. OR 3. It does not have an ozone layer. OR 4. It does not rotate fast enough. Answer:\n2. Its rotation axis is nearly perpendicular to the plane of the Solar System.\n\nQuestion: [question] Choices: [choices] Answer: [answer]\nQuestion: Why are the inner planets made of denser materials than the outer planets? Choices: 1. In the beginning when the protoplanetary disk was spinning faster centrifugal forces flung the lighter materials toward the outer parts of the solar nebula. OR 2. When the solar nebula formed a disk materials naturally segregated into bands and in our particular solar system the denser materials settled nearer the Sun while lighter materials are found in the outer part. OR 3. In the inner part of the nebula only metals and rocks were able to condense because of the high temperatures whereas hydrogen compounds although more abundant were only able to condense in the cooler outer regions. OR 4. Denser materials were heavier and sank to the center of the nebula. Answer:\n", "Result": "1.
