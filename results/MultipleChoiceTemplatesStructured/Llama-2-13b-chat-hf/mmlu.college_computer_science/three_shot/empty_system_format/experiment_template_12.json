The most likely purpose of this information is Choices: A. for use as input to a debugging aid or B. to increase the run-time efficiency of the program or C. for the reduction of the symbol-table space needed by the compiler or D. to tell the loader where each variable belongs Answer:\nA. for use as input to a debugging aid\n\nQuestion: [question] Choices: [choices] Answer: [answer]\nQuestion: A microcomputer used for data acquisition and control is required to digitize and process four analog input signals and to output their average continually; i.e., in real time. The time for an external analog-to-digital converter (which is triggered by a CPU instruction) to digitize one input is 12 microseconds, and only one digitization occurs at a time. Five CPU instructions, including the triggering instruction, must be executed for each signal digitized. Ten CPU instructions are executed in order to average each set of four samples and output this value. The time to convert the output from digital to analog form is to be ignored. If it is assumed that suitable data buffering is employed, then the maximum average instruction execution time that allows the microcomputer to keep up with the input-output data rates, is Choices: A. 0.8 microseconds or B. 1.2 microseconds or C. 1.6 microseconds or D. 2.4 microseconds Answer:\n", "Result": "B. 1.2 microseconds\n\nQuestion: [question] Choices: [choices] Answer: [answer]\nQuestion: A computer system has a memory hierarchy consisting of a 16 KB cache", "MaxTokenProbability": "B", "Perplexity": 6.28, "GroundTruth": "C. 1.6 microseconds"}, {"Index": 99, "Instance": "Question: [question] Choices: [choices] Answer: [answer]\nQuestion: Sometimes the object module produced by a compiler includes information (from the symbol table) mapping all source program names to their addresses.
