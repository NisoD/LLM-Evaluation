Which of the following will NOT deal effectively with the problem of deadlock? Choices: I. Having processes time out and restart after a random interval of waiting; II. Giving priorities to processes and ordering the wait queues by priority; III. Numbering the resources and requiring that processes request resources in order of increasing number; IV.
