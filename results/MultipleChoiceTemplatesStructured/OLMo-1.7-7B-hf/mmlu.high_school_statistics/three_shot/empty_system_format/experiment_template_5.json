There is evidence to conclude that the new process is producing engines with a mean thrust under 9500 pounds., C. 99.31% of the engines produced under the new process will have a thrust under 9500 pounds., D. 0.69% of the time an engine produced under the new process will have a thrust over 9500 pounds. Answer:\n", "Result": "D. 0.69% of the time an engine produced under the new process will have a thrust over 9500 pounds.", "MaxTokenProbability": null, "GroundTruth": "B.

The results were stated as 67% with a margin of error of \u00b13%. What is meant by \u00b13%? Choices: A. Three percent of the population were not surveyed., B. The percentage of the entire population of parents who would support raising the driving age is between 64% and 70%., C. It is unlikely that the given sample proportion result could be obtained unless the true percentage was between 64% and 70%., D. In the sample, the percentage of parents who would support raising the driving age is between 64% and 70%. Answer:\nC.
