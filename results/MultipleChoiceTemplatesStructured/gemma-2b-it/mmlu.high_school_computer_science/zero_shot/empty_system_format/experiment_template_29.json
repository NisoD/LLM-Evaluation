Which of the following best describes the possibility of improving the running speed of the game? Choices: 1. The game's running speed cannot be improved because the game is an example of an algorithm that does not run in a reasonable time. 2. The game's running speed might be improved by using a process that finds approximate solutions every time the computer-controlled player has a turn. 3.
