Its rotation axis is nearly perpendicular to the plane of the Solar System.\n\nQuestion: [question] Choices: [choices] Answer: [answer]\nQuestion: Why are the inner planets made of denser materials than the outer planets? Choices: 1. In the beginning when the protoplanetary disk was spinning faster centrifugal forces flung the lighter materials toward the outer parts of the solar nebula.; 2. When the solar nebula formed a disk materials naturally segregated into bands and in our particular solar system the denser materials settled nearer the Sun while lighter materials are found in the outer part.; 3. In the inner part of the nebula only metals and rocks were able to condense because of the high temperatures whereas hydrogen compounds although more abundant were only able to condense in the cooler outer regions.; 4. Denser materials were heavier and sank to the center of the nebula. Answer:\n", "Result": "4. Denser materials were heavier and sank to the center of the nebula.\n\nQuestion: [question", "MaxTokenProbability": "4", "GroundTruth": "3.
