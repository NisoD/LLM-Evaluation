The woman's complaint included a lengthy description of what the supervisor had said and done over the years, quoting his telephone calls and emails to her and her own emails to the supervisor's manager asking for help. The employer moved for summary judgment, alleging that the woman was a pathological liar who had filed the action and included fictitious documents in revenge for having been fired. Because the woman's attorney was at a lengthy out-of-state trial when the summary-judgment motion was filed, he failed to respond to it.

Yes, because the woman's failure to respond to the summary-judgment motion was a default giving sufficient basis to grant the motion. | II. Yes, because the woman's failure to respond to the summary-judgment motion means that there was no sworn affidavit to support her allegations and supporting documents. | III.

The so-called installment land contract has been popular as a substitute for the mortgage or deed of trust. Under such a contract, the seller agrees to accept, and the buyer agrees to pay, the purchase price in installments over a stipulated period of time. The vendor retains legal title as security for the payment of the purchase price; and the vendee has equitable title under the doctrine of equitable conversion. The most important characteristic of the installment land contract, however, is the forfeiture clause, which provides that if the vendee is in default for 30 days, the vendor may, at his option, declare a forfeiture of the contract, in which case all payments made shall be forfeited as \"liquidated\" damages and the buyer shall become a tenant at will of the seller. Over the years, many sellers of property under such installment land contracts have declared forfeitures in situations where the prospective buyers were delinquent in their payments, even when the buyer was late with a single payment after nearly all the other payments had been made. In order to remedy this inequitable situation, the state legislature enacted a statute requiring any seller attempting to declare a forfeiture of an installment land contract to do so by instituting a formal foreclosure action in the courts. The new law also provided that prior to the commencement of such a foreclosure action, the seller under such an arrangement must give the buyer a 60-day grace period to make up any delinquent installment payment with interest. The new law expressly applied both to installment land contracts entered into subsequent to its enactment and to installment land contracts already in existence at the time of its enactment. Is this new state statute likely to be held constitutional? Choices: I. Yes, because the authority to enact laws regulating real estate sales transactions occurring within the boundaries of individual states is reserved exclusively to the states by the Tenth Amendment. | II. No, because application of the law to installment land contracts entered into before or after its enactment is a deprivation of a proprietary interest without due process of the law. | III. No, because application of the law to installment land contracts entered into prior to its enactment is a violation of the obligation of contracts. | IV. Yes, because it is a reasonable regulation of the procedure to be followed in such cases and does not substantially diminish the underlying obligations of the buyer. Answer:\n", "Result": "IV.

The store was temporarily closed during the renovation period. The day the supermarket reopened, the store manager noticed that small fragments of plaster had fallen from a section of the ceiling. He promptly posted signs warning shoppers of the hazardous condition. The signs, which were printed in bold letters, read: \"ATTENTION SHOPPERS - BE ON THE LOOKOUT FOR FALLiNG PLASTER. \"That same afternoon, a shopper was shopping in the supermarket and noticed the signs. She looked at the ceiling but didn't see any plaster falling. Moments later, she was placing some squash in a bag when a section of the ceiling suddenly fell on her head. She suffered a concussion and head lacerations. Thereafter, the shopper brought a tort action against the supermarket to recover for the injuries she suffered. Her attorney hired a physician to examine the shopper in order to assist the attorney in preparing the case.

Acting under a state law authorizing the destruction of buildings that are used for illegal activity, the city destroyed the man\u00d5s house. The man\u00d5s family then rented an apartment and demanded that the city pay the rent for that temporary residence. The family relied on a state law providing that any person who was dispossessed of his or her place of residence because of the actions of city officials was entitled to replacement housing at the city\u00d5s expense until permanent substitute housing could be found. When the city refused to pay the rent for the apartment, the man\u00d5s family sued the city in a state trial court claiming a right to such payment under both the state law and the due process clause of the Fourteenth Amendment to the United States Constitution. The highest state court ruled for the family. Although the court decided that the family had no right to payment under the state law, it held that the Fourteenth Amendment entitled the family to payment of the rent for the temporary apart-ment. In its opinion, the highest state court indicated that in several of its decisions it had found cities liable for compen-sation in similar situations on the basis of the due process clause of the state constitution.

Five years ago the man conveyed a right-of-way easement over his land to the woman because it provided a more direct route between her house and the highway. The easement was evidenced by a clearly marked path. The document granting the easement was promptly recorded. Three years ago, the woman conveyed her house to the man. The man never took actual possession of the house. Two years ago, the man conveyed the house to a purchaser by a warranty deed. Two months after the purchaser moved into the house, a neighbor informed him about the easement. He then began using the path that had been marked on the man's land.

The stadium, which was built in 1932, had been the home stadium for the local professional baseball team for 30 years. However, in 1962, the baseball team franchise moved to another city. Since 1962, the stadium was left unattended and had deteriorated to such an extent that the walls were in danger of collapsing. Last month, an earthquake struck the city. The earthquake, which registered 6. 9 on the Richter scale, caused considerable damage in the city and caused the stadium to collapse. As the stadium crumbled to the ground, a large section of the press box fell on top of a car that was parked nearby. The auto was crushed, causing its gas tank to rupture. As a result, a large quantity of gasoline spilled along the street and flowed downhill. The gasoline collected in front of a homeowner's home, which was located about a mile from the stadium. Two hours after the earthquake struck, a pedestrian was walking in front of the homeowner's home, smoking a cigarette. When he discarded his lighted cigarette butt in the street, the gasoline exploded. The explosion blew the windows out of the homeowner's home.

Darlene, who was a waitress at a local restaurant, devised a scheme whereby she would contaminate oysters at her restaurant with small amounts of a poisonous substance.

When the officer accepted the job, the city's employee benefit plan provided a death benefit to the spouse of any employee who died as a result of any job-related injury. Last year, the city amended its employee benefit plan to deny its death benefit in cases where the death \"was caused by the employee's refusal to accept, for any reason other than its excessive risk to life or health, reasonably available medical care prescribed by a physician.\" After this amendment took effect, the officer was shot while on duty. Because of a sincerely held religious belief, the officer refused to allow a prescribed blood transfusion and, as a result, died from loss of blood. When the officer's spouse applied for the death benefit, the city denied the application on the basis of the amendment to the employee benefit plan.

The lease contains the following provisions\"(1) The tenant covenants to keep the building on the leased premises insured against fire in the amount of $100,000. \"After three years of the lease had expired, the tenant assigned the entire balance of the lease period to a doctor, who took immediate possession of the leased property.

Soon afterwards, a fire spread from an adjoining building to the leased property, completely destroying the building thereon. While the tenant was in possession of the leased property, he carried a fire insurance policy on the premises in the amount of $100,000. However, the tenant allowed the policy to lapse after his assignment to the doctor. The doctor did carry insurance on the leased building, but only in the amount of $50,000.

He conducted a small farming operation on the property and grew corn, broccoli, and other vegetables, which he sold to local produce companies. One day, the county police received an anonymous tip that the defendant was growing marijuana on his farm. Acting on this information, in an unmarked vehicle, two undercover police officers then drove to the defendant's farm. They climbed over a chain-link fence and walked around the farm. While surveying the terrain, they came upon a small marijuana patch. The officers then noticed fresh footprints that led from the marijuana patch to a nearby cabin. Believing that marijuana was being stored in the cabin, the police officers decided to immediately secure a search warrant. After obtaining the warrant, they returned to the defendant's farm and entered the cabin. Inside the cabin, the police found a large amount of marijuana that had been recently harvested. The defendant was then arrested and charged with unlawful possession of marijuana.

An organization of influential city residents began an intensive lobbying effort to persuade the city council to deny the owner a permit to operate any type of nude- dancing facility at any time or in any place in the city. The owner has sued the city in an appropriate federal court, seeking an injunction that would prohibit the city council from considering the organization's views, on the ground that if the organization is successful in its lobbying efforts, the owner's First and Fourteenth Amendment rights would be violated. The city has moved to dismiss the action. Should the court dismiss the owner's action? Choices: I. Yes, because the First and Fourteenth Amendments do not protect obscenity, and nude dancing is obscene. | II. No, because nude dancing is symbolic speech and is therefore protected by the First and Fourteenth Amendments. | III.

She approached Microhard and secured a lease agreement for over half of the available square footage. The lease was not recorded, but the agreement allowed Denise to attract other wealthy tenants. She also disclosed the Microhard lease on her application for a $1,500,000 construction loan from Maximum Mortgage Company. Denise executed a mortgage and related promissory note in favor of Maximum. Maximum recorded the mortgage immediately. The office building was completed and Denise had more tenant demand than available space, so the building opened full. One year later, Denise ran into financial trouble and defaulted on the mortgage. Maximum took possession and immediately notified all the tenants that their leases were cancelled, that they were evicted, and that they must vacate immediately unless they were willing to sign a new lease at double the previous rent. The recording statute in the jurisdiction specified \"every conveyance, encumbrance, or lease not recorded is void as against any subsequent party recording first.\" The tenants retained you to compel Maximum to honor the leases at the lower rents. Which of the following statements of advice is the most accurate? Choices: I. Microhard is entitled to continue their lease because Maximum had constructive notice of their prior lease. | II. All the tenants will prevail (unless otherwise in default on their leases), because Maximum loaned money to Denise with actual knowledge that she intended to enter into binding leases with the tenants. | III.

He has been mulling an idea in his mind to take a lot of money from his employer using his computer skills, and he has worked out a general plan in his mind. Once he obtains the money, he thinks it might be good to let a candle drop and have the whole building burn down. While he is out at lunch, the janitorial staff came through his office.

Under an inseparable provision of the statute, the commission was authorized to suspend the racing license of any trainer whose horse tested positive for illegal drugs. The statute permitted the commission to make the suspension without any prior hearing. However, suspended trainers were entitled to a prompt post- suspension hearing and decision on any issues in dispute. The racing season was inaugurated at the largest racetrack in the state. The featured race was a $1,000,000 harness race for 2-year-old trotters. After the awards presentation, the winning horse underwent a standard drug test and traces of cocaine were found in his urine sample.

Due to the precipitous drop in oil prices, many oil companies have been forced to cut back on oil production and lay off many workers. As a result, unemployment has reached all-time high levels in several states. In order to alleviate this potentially catastrophic situation, the one of those state's legislatures recently enacted a statute requiring that 10% of all oil produced within the state be purchased by the state and reserved for use by state residents. The purpose of the statute was twofold: (1) it was intended to stimulate the oil industry within the state by encouraging more production and exploration, and (2) it was designed to create an oil reserve so that state residents and industries would not suffer unduly from future oil shortages. Subsequently, Congress enacted a statute forbidding states to reserve local resources for local use in this manner. Is this state statute constitutional? Choices: I. No, because application of the statute denies non-oil producing companies to equal protection of the law, in violation of the Fourteenth Amendment.  | II. Yes, because Congress has not expressly forbidden states to reserve local resources for local use.  | III. No, because a state may not protect its residents from out-of-state competition for its natural resources without the express permission of Congress.  | IV.

Some years prior to her death, she conveyed a deed in fee simple to her oldest son. After her death, her youngest son filed a claim against the estate contending that the father's will devised only a life estate to his wife. A state statute said that a fee simple would be presumed where the intent of the testator did not clearly show an intent to devise a lesser estate. The lower court held that the widow had received a defeasible fee conditioned on her remaining a widow.

Reluctantly, the developer concluded that he would have to purchase a developed lot, have the existing structures removed, and then build the apartment house. The developer was reluctant to do this, because he had not budgeted for the additional cost of buying a developed property and removing the development.

He then spent $50,000 having the residential home removed from the lot. Knowing that it would cost approximately $850,000 to build the apartment house, the developer realized he would need to raise another $100,000. He approached an investor about lending him $100,000.

During the first year of the contract, the girl made 12 monthly payments totaling $6,000. However, the girl failed to make any payments during the second year of the contract. The retailer repeatedly threatened to sue the girl for the remaining balance that it claimed was due under the contract. However, the retailer never followed through on this threat. Shortly after the girl turned 18, she sent the following letter to the retailer:\"I had to stop making payments because I ran out of money. I am hoping that will change shortly. However, I've been told I am not obligated to pay anything more to you, because I was underage when we entered into the contract. But I want to be fair. I am willing to pay you $3,000 by the end of the year if my financial position improves. \"The girl never made any further payment to the retailer.

The woman's complaint included a lengthy description of what the supervisor had said and done over the years, quoting his telephone calls and emails to her and her own emails to the supervisor's manager asking for help. The employer moved for summary judgment, alleging that the woman was a pathological liar who had filed the action and included fictitious documents in revenge for having been fired. Because the woman's attorney was at a lengthy out-of-state trial when the summary-judgment motion was filed, he failed to respond to it. The court therefore granted the motion in a one-line order and entered final judgment. The woman has appealed. Is the appellate court likely to uphold the trial court's ruling? Choices: I. Yes, because the woman's failure to respond to the summary-judgment motion was a default giving sufficient basis to grant the motion. | II. Yes, because the woman's failure to respond to the summary-judgment motion means that there was no sworn affidavit to support her allegations and supporting documents. | III. No, because the complaint's allegations were detailed and specific. | IV. No, because the employer moved for summary judgment on the basis that the woman was not credible, creating a factual dispute.

The man was convicted of selling large quantities of an illegal drug from his house. Acting under a state law authorizing the destruction of buildings that are used for illegal activity, the city destroyed the man\u00d5s house. The man\u00d5s family then rented an apartment and demanded that the city pay the rent for that temporary residence. The family relied on a state law providing that any person who was dispossessed of his or her place of residence because of the actions of city officials was entitled to replacement housing at the city\u00d5s expense until permanent substitute housing could be found. When the city refused to pay the rent for the apartment, the man\u00d5s family sued the city in a state trial court claiming a right to such payment under both the state law and the due process clause of the Fourteenth Amendment to the United States Constitution. The highest state court ruled for the family. Although the court decided that the family had no right to payment under the state law, it held that the Fourteenth Amendment entitled the family to payment of the rent for the temporary apart-ment. In its opinion, the highest state court indicated that in several of its decisions it had found cities liable for compen-sation in similar situations on the basis of the due process clause of the state constitution. But the highest state court declined to base its holding on the state constitution because that issue had not been properly raised in the case. The city then filed a petition for a writ of certiorari in the United States Supreme Court. Does the Court have jurisdiction to review the merits of this case? Choices: I. Yes, because the highest state court based its decision wholly on federal law grounds. | II. No, because independent state law grounds could have been used to justify the result in this case. | III. No, because the decision of the highest state court ren-ders the case moot. | IV.

On February 28, the farmer telephoned the chef and said, \"Because my two sons were injured yesterday, I won't be able to deliver your mushrooms on March 1. However, I am trying to hire some other farm hands to help process your order. Although I can't promise it, I should be able to deliver the mushrooms by the end of the week. \" The chef, who knew that the fanner's sons were responsible for the mushroom farming, said, \"No problem.

In accordance with the new law, all beer consumed within the state must be sold in aluminum cans that are recyclable. There is a provision of the statute that does permit breweries to distribute beer to bars, taverns, and restaurants in kegs for \"on-site\" consumption by patrons. Before the passage of the law, approximately 28% of all beer consumed in the state was packaged in glass bottles. Of that total, 75% of the beer was bottled outside the state, while 25% was bottled by companies in-state. The legislature passed the law at the strong urging of the aluminum can industry. It was estimated that one aluminum company alone spent over $5,000,000 in its lobbying campaign for the passage of the bill. Ironically, the new law even received strong support from environmentalists who believed that recyclable cans would help prevent littering and unsightly trash accumulation. The strongest federal constitutional argument against the validity of the law is that it violates the Choices: I. contracts clause by impairing the ability of beer bottlers to honor existing contracts for the sale of bottled beer in the state. | II. equal protection clause of the Fourteenth Amendment by discriminating against beer bottlers. | III. commerce clause by violating the negative implications on interstate commerce. | IV. privileges or immunities clause of the Fourteenth Amendment by preventing out-of-state beer bottlers from conducting their business in the state.

The plant had been shut down for 10 years. Much to Darlene's chagrin, officials at the plant had announced plans to reopen the plant. Darlene, who was a waitress at a local restaurant, devised a scheme whereby she would contaminate oysters at her restaurant with small amounts of a poisonous substance. Although she didn't want to seriously injure anyone, Darlene believed that if some people got sick from eating the oysters, they would attribute their illness to nuclear waste from the power plant. To facilitate her plan, she stole some poison from a local pharmacy. She sprinkled it on some oysters at the restaurant where she worked. Mistakenly, she put too much of the poison on some of the oysters. A few of the customers who ate the oysters became sick and nauseated. One person suffered convulsions and died from the poisoning. A statute in the jurisdiction provides: \"Any intentional and premeditated killing, or one occurring during the perpetration of a felony, is murder in the first degree. Murder in the second degree is murder with intent to cause serious bodily harm. Manslaughter is an unlawful killing due to recklessness. \"Assault with intent to kill or to cause serious physical injury is a felony in the jurisdiction.

The written contract entered included a \"production fee clause\" that provided that the production company would be \"paid $100,000 for the filming and editing of ten 30-second commercials\" that would be suitable for the candidate's television campaign broadcasts. The production fee clause also stipulated that the $100,000 would be paid to the production company \"on condition that the filming and editing be directed under the personal supervision of the president of the production company. \" The contract made no other reference to compensation. Thereafter, the production company filmed and edited the ten campaign commercials, which the candidate approved. When the production was completed, the production company submitted to the candidate an invoice statement in the amount of $150,000. Besides the $100,000 contract figure, the bill included a $50,000 charge for the president's full-time services in directing the filming and editing of the videos. Denying any additional liability, the candidate sent the production company a check for $100,000. The production company then brought suit against the candidate to recover the $50,000 to cover the president's services. Which of the following arguments would be most persuasive in the candidate's efforts to prevent the introduction of parol evidence to show that prior to the parties' execution of the written contract they had orally agreed on payment by the candidate to cover the president's salary in addition to the $100,000 production fee? Choices: I. Since the agreement contained a compensation clause that specified a stipulated amount, the contract was fully integrated on that subject.  | II.

The rental agreement provided that the land was to be used as farmland. Shortly after the tenant took possession of the tract of land, he built thereon, at his own expense, a barn made of lumber, which was 15 feet wide, 20 feet long, and set on loose bricks. The barn increased the appraised market value of the tract of land from $250,000 to $275,000. The tenant then began farming operations on the land. Toward the end of the lease period, the owner informed the tenant that he was going to put the tract of land up for sale. The next month, when the lease expired, the parties settled a dispute over the tenant's right, if any, to compensation for the improvements by the following written agreement:\"On the sale of the tract of land, the owner hereby agrees to pay the tenant two-thirds of any sale proceeds in excess of $250,000, provided that tenant may remain on the farm for the next year, rent-free, while the owner tries to sell it. After that time, the tenant may remain on the land until closing of the sale, at a monthly rental of $1,000. \"The owner initially set the asking price at $300,000. After receiving scant interest, the owner decided to reduce the price to $260,000. This price reduction so infuriated the tenant that he thereafter made negative comments about the farm to all of the prospective buyers. Finally, 14 months after the agreement between the owner and the tenant was executed, and after rejecting offers for $240,000 and $250,000, the owner sold the tract of land for $256,000 to a buyer who visited the land while the tenant was away on vacation. Thereupon, the tenant, who had failed to pay the last two months rent as per the agreement, moved out. After closing, the owner refused to pay the tenant any of the sale proceeds, and the tenant brought suit to recover damages for breach of contract. Which of the following is the owner's most persuasive argument in defense of the tenant's suit? Choices: I. The agreement between the owner and the tenant was voidable because it was a restraint on alienation, since it conditioned a promise to pay for a conveyance of land upon an otherwise invalid leasehold contract. | II. The tenant committed an uncured material breach of an implied promise to cooperate in the owner's efforts to sell the property, or at least not to hinder the proposed sale. | III. The tenant's negative comments about the farm to prospective buyers amounted to an anticipatory repudiation of the agreement between the owner and the tenant. | IV. The tenant's failure to pay any rent for the last two months was a material breach of contract that discharged the owner's remaining duties of performance. Answer:\n", "Result": "II.

On behalf of his company, he borrowed $500,000 from a credit union for this purpose. The company was to repay the loan at the rate of $2,500 per month. The loan was secured by a mortgage on the building that housed the company's operation center. Eight months later, the company's sales started to drop and the company began experiencing cash flow problems. As a result, the company failed to make its loan payments for three consecutive months, causing the credit union to threaten to foreclose on the mortgage. The president's father, a retired wealthy investor, then intervened on behalf of the company, paid the three missed loan payments, and told the credit union that if they would refrain from any legal action against the company for a year, he would personally see that the debt was paid. The credit union orally agreed to the father's surety arrangement. However, it was never reduced to writing. Six months later, the company once again missed consecutive payments, and the credit union filed a foreclosure suit against the company. The father did not learn of the suit until a week later, but he raised no objection, since he thought the credit union was violating its agreement with him by foreclosing within the one-year period, thus relieving him of his part of the bargain. Two weeks later, the credit union's loan officer called the father and said that the credit union would hold off on the foreclosure suit as per their agreement, since the company had just made a new technological development that would place it in a very lucrative and competitive position.

The statute authorized pari-mutuel betting at certain track locations within the state. A seven-member commission was established and empowered to supervise and regulate the sport's activities. Under an inseparable provision of the statute, the commission was authorized to suspend the racing license of any trainer whose horse tested positive for illegal drugs. The statute permitted the commission to make the suspension without any prior hearing. However, suspended trainers were entitled to a prompt post- suspension hearing and decision on any issues in dispute. The racing season was inaugurated at the largest racetrack in the state. The featured race was a $1,000,000 harness race for 2-year-old trotters. After the awards presentation, the winning horse underwent a standard drug test and traces of cocaine were found in his urine sample.

The purpose of the statute was twofold: (1) it was intended to stimulate the oil industry within the state by encouraging more production and exploration, and (2) it was designed to create an oil reserve so that state residents and industries would not suffer unduly from future oil shortages. Subsequently, Congress enacted a statute forbidding states to reserve local resources for local use in this manner. Is this state statute constitutional? Choices: I. No, because application of the statute denies non-oil producing companies to equal protection of the law, in violation of the Fourteenth Amendment.  | II. Yes, because Congress has not expressly forbidden states to reserve local resources for local use.  | III. No, because a state may not protect its residents from out-of-state competition for its natural resources without the express permission of Congress.  | IV. Yes, because the state statute requires that the oil be used for the general welfare of the people in emergency situations.  Answer:\nIII. No, because a state may not protect its residents from out-of-state competition for its natural resources without the express permission of Congress. \n\nQuestion: [question] Choices: [choices] Answer: [answer]\nQuestion: A privately owned shopping center leases retail store space to private retailers.

The next day, he was cutting the grass in his back yard with the mower when it started to rain. He stopped the mower and turned off the motor switch. He went inside and decided to wait until the rain stopped before mowing the rest of the lawn. A few minutes later while the homeowner was inside his house, the lawnmower suddenly lurched forward, rolled down a hill, and entered the property of his neighbor. The mower cut the neighbor's prize rosebushes, destroying them. It was later determined that the lawnmower's motor switch was defective. Even though the homeowner had turned the starter switch to the off position, the engine did not shut off. Because the mower was built with a new silent rotary engine, the homeowner had no reason to know that it was still running when he went into the house. The homeowner would not have been able to discover the defect by any feasible means of inspection. If the neighbor asserts a claim against the homeowner for trespass, will the neighbor prevail? Choices: I. No, because the homeowner was using the mower for its intended purpose. | II. No, because the defective motor switch was not discoverable by reasonable inspection. | III. Yes, because the lawnmower entered onto the neighbor's property. | IV. Yes, because the homeowner is strictly liable for the damage caused by the defective mower. Answer:\n", "Result": "II.

Due to the precipitous drop in oil prices, many oil companies have been forced to cut back on oil production and lay off many workers. As a result, unemployment has reached all-time high levels in several states. In order to alleviate this potentially catastrophic situation, the one of those state's legislatures recently enacted a statute requiring that 10% of all oil produced within the state be purchased by the state and reserved for use by state residents. The purpose of the statute was twofold: (1) it was intended to stimulate the oil industry within the state by encouraging more production and exploration, and (2) it was designed to create an oil reserve so that state residents and industries would not suffer unduly from future oil shortages. Subsequently, Congress enacted a statute forbidding states to reserve local resources for local use in this manner. Is this state statute constitutional? Choices: I. No, because application of the statute denies non-oil producing companies to equal protection of the law, in violation of the Fourteenth Amendment.  | II. Yes, because Congress has not expressly forbidden states to reserve local resources for local use.  | III. No, because a state may not protect its residents from out-of-state competition for its natural resources without the express permission of Congress.  | IV.

In support of his contention, the officer seeks to introduce evidence that the man had resisted arrest on three prior occasions during the last 10 years. Is this testimony regarding the man's conduct during the three prior arrests admissible?  Choices: I.

It authorizes the president of either country to issue a proclamation nullifying any state or local laws in that country that have the effect of impeding imports from the other country. The foreign country uses the metric system of measurement, and thus all goods produced there and exported to the United States are packaged in metric sizes, such as liters and kilograms. A law of a state in the United States requires all goods sold in that state to be packaged in traditional American sizes, such as quarts or pounds. Because the state law substantially impedes imports from the foreign country, the President of the United States has issued a proclamation nullifying the state law pursuant to the treaty. Is the President's proclamation valid? Choices: I. Yes, because it is authorized by a valid treaty of the United States and is not prohibited by any provision of the Constitution and, therefore, is the supreme law of the land. | II. No, because the principles of federalism embedded in the Constitution prohibit the President from taking action to invalidate a state law. | III.

A new federal statute requires all power equipment, including lawn mowers, to be labeled with energy efficiency stickers to permit purchasers to make informed choices when buying such equipment. The statute does not expressly preempt state law. Assume that no other federal statute or administrative regulation addresses the energy efficiency of power equipment. Which of the following is the best argument the state can make for the continued validity of its law?  Choices: I. The law is unaffected by the federal statute, because Congress did not expressly prohibit state laws requiring power equipment to meet specified levels of fuel efficiency. | II. The purpose of the law is consistent with the purpose of the federal statute, enforcement of the law would not interfere with the full execution of the statute, and there is no evidence that Congress intended to preclude the states from enacting supplemental laws on this subject. | III. There is a very strong presumption that a specific state law on a subject normally within the state's police power prevails over a more general federal statute, because the Tenth Amendment reserves to the states primary authority over matters affecting public health, welfare, and safety. | IV. Congress cannot preempt state laws requiring a specified minimum level of requiring a specified minimum level of fuel efficiency for lawn mowers, because the use of such equipment is a wholly local event and, therefore, is beyond the regulatory authority vested in Congress by the commerce clause.

A nonresident, in order to hunt elk, was required to purchase a combination license at a cost of $225. 00; this entitled him to take one elk, one deer, and one black bear. A nonresident, however, could obtain a license restricted to deer for $51. 00. A resident was not required to buy any combination of licenses but if he did, the cost to him of all the privileges granted by the nonresident combination license was $30. 00. Due to its successful management program for elk, the state has not been compelled to limit the overall number of hunters by means of drawings or lotteries, as have other states. Elk are not hunted commercially in the state. Nonresident hunters seek the animal for its trophy value; the trophy is the distinctive set of antlers.  \u0080\u0098. Vhereas the interest of resident hunters more often may be in the meat, among nonresident hunters, big-game hunting is clearly a sport in the state.

The statute authorized pari-mutuel betting at certain track locations within the state. A seven-member commission was established and empowered to supervise and regulate the sport's activities. Under an inseparable provision of the statute, the commission was authorized to suspend the racing license of any trainer whose horse tested positive for illegal drugs. The statute permitted the commission to make the suspension without any prior hearing. However, suspended trainers were entitled to a prompt post- suspension hearing and decision on any issues in dispute. The racing season was inaugurated at the largest racetrack in the state.

On behalf of his company, he borrowed $500,000 from a credit union for this purpose. The company was to repay the loan at the rate of $2,500 per month. The loan was secured by a mortgage on the building that housed the company's operation center. Eight months later, the company's sales started to drop and the company began experiencing cash flow problems. As a result, the company failed to make its loan payments for three consecutive months, causing the credit union to threaten to foreclose on the mortgage. The president's father, a retired wealthy investor, then intervened on behalf of the company, paid the three missed loan payments, and told the credit union that if they would refrain from any legal action against the company for a year, he would personally see that the debt was paid. The credit union orally agreed to the father's surety arrangement. However, it was never reduced to writing. Six months later, the company once again missed consecutive payments, and the credit union filed a foreclosure suit against the company. The father did not learn of the suit until a week later, but he raised no objection, since he thought the credit union was violating its agreement with him by foreclosing within the one-year period, thus relieving him of his part of the bargain. Two weeks later, the credit union's loan officer called the father and said that the credit union would hold off on the foreclosure suit as per their agreement, since the company had just made a new technological development that would place it in a very lucrative and competitive position.

In accordance with the new law, all beer consumed within the state must be sold in aluminum cans that are recyclable. There is a provision of the statute that does permit breweries to distribute beer to bars, taverns, and restaurants in kegs for \"on-site\" consumption by patrons. Before the passage of the law, approximately 28% of all beer consumed in the state was packaged in glass bottles. Of that total, 75% of the beer was bottled outside the state, while 25% was bottled by companies in-state. The legislature passed the law at the strong urging of the aluminum can industry. It was estimated that one aluminum company alone spent over $5,000,000 in its lobbying campaign for the passage of the bill. Ironically, the new law even received strong support from environmentalists who believed that recyclable cans would help prevent littering and unsightly trash accumulation. The strongest federal constitutional argument against the validity of the law is that it violates the Choices: I. contracts clause by impairing the ability of beer bottlers to honor existing contracts for the sale of bottled beer in the state. | II. equal protection clause of the Fourteenth Amendment by discriminating against beer bottlers. | III. commerce clause by violating the negative implications on interstate commerce. | IV. privileges or immunities clause of the Fourteenth Amendment by preventing out-of-state beer bottlers from conducting their business in the state.

He conducted a small farming operation on the property and grew corn, broccoli, and other vegetables, which he sold to local produce companies. One day, the county police received an anonymous tip that the defendant was growing marijuana on his farm. Acting on this information, in an unmarked vehicle, two undercover police officers then drove to the defendant's farm. They climbed over a chain-link fence and walked around the farm. While surveying the terrain, they came upon a small marijuana patch. The officers then noticed fresh footprints that led from the marijuana patch to a nearby cabin. Believing that marijuana was being stored in the cabin, the police officers decided to immediately secure a search warrant. After obtaining the warrant, they returned to the defendant's farm and entered the cabin. Inside the cabin, the police found a large amount of marijuana that had been recently harvested. The defendant was then arrested and charged with unlawful possession of marijuana. The defendant files a pretrial motion to suppress the marijuana as evidence on grounds of an illegal search and seizure. The motion should be Choices: I. granted, because the marijuana was the fruit of an illegal search and seizure, since the police did not have probable cause to conduct their investigation.  | II. denied, because the officers secured a warrant before entering the cabin despite the fact that their earlier actions may have been unlawful.  | III. denied, because the warrant was validly issued and based upon information lawfully obtained.  | IV. granted, because the police were unlawfully on the defendant's property when the marijuana was initially discovered.

The woman's complaint included a lengthy description of what the supervisor had said and done over the years, quoting his telephone calls and emails to her and her own emails to the supervisor's manager asking for help. The employer moved for summary judgment, alleging that the woman was a pathological liar who had filed the action and included fictitious documents in revenge for having been fired. Because the woman's attorney was at a lengthy out-of-state trial when the summary-judgment motion was filed, he failed to respond to it. The court therefore granted the motion in a one-line order and entered final judgment. The woman has appealed. Is the appellate court likely to uphold the trial court's ruling? Choices: I. Yes, because the woman's failure to respond to the summary-judgment motion was a default giving sufficient basis to grant the motion. | II. Yes, because the woman's failure to respond to the summary-judgment motion means that there was no sworn affidavit to support her allegations and supporting documents. | III.

Due to the precipitous drop in oil prices, many oil companies have been forced to cut back on oil production and lay off many workers. As a result, unemployment has reached all-time high levels in several states. In order to alleviate this potentially catastrophic situation, the one of those state's legislatures recently enacted a statute requiring that 10% of all oil produced within the state be purchased by the state and reserved for use by state residents. The purpose of the statute was twofold: (1) it was intended to stimulate the oil industry within the state by encouraging more production and exploration, and (2) it was designed to create an oil reserve so that state residents and industries would not suffer unduly from future oil shortages. Subsequently, Congress enacted a statute forbidding states to reserve local resources for local use in this manner. Is this state statute constitutional? Choices: I. No, because application of the statute denies non-oil producing companies to equal protection of the law, in violation of the Fourteenth Amendment.  | II. Yes, because Congress has not expressly forbidden states to reserve local resources for local use.  | III. No, because a state may not protect its residents from out-of-state competition for its natural resources without the express permission of Congress.  | IV. Yes, because the state statute requires that the oil be used for the general welfare of the people in emergency situations.  Answer:\nIII.

Several years later, at a time when the woman still owed the bank $750,000 on the mortgage loan, she sold the farm to a man for $900,000. The man paid the woman $150,000 in cash and specifically assumed the mortgage note. The bank received notice of this transaction and elected not to exer-cise the optional due-on-sale clause in the mortgage. Without informing the man, the bank later released the woman from any further personal liability on the note. After he had owned the farm for a number of years, the man defaulted on the loan. The bank properly accelerated the loan, and the farm was eventually sold at a foreclosure sale for $500,000. Because there was still $600,000 owing on the note, the bank sued the man for the $100,000 deficiency. Is the man liable to the bank for the deficiency? Choices: I.

On behalf of his company, he borrowed $500,000 from a credit union for this purpose. The company was to repay the loan at the rate of $2,500 per month. The loan was secured by a mortgage on the building that housed the company's operation center. Eight months later, the company's sales started to drop and the company began experiencing cash flow problems. As a result, the company failed to make its loan payments for three consecutive months, causing the credit union to threaten to foreclose on the mortgage. The president's father, a retired wealthy investor, then intervened on behalf of the company, paid the three missed loan payments, and told the credit union that if they would refrain from any legal action against the company for a year, he would personally see that the debt was paid. The credit union orally agreed to the father's surety arrangement. However, it was never reduced to writing. Six months later, the company once again missed consecutive payments, and the credit union filed a foreclosure suit against the company. The father did not learn of the suit until a week later, but he raised no objection, since he thought the credit union was violating its agreement with him by foreclosing within the one-year period, thus relieving him of his part of the bargain. Two weeks later, the credit union's loan officer called the father and said that the credit union would hold off on the foreclosure suit as per their agreement, since the company had just made a new technological development that would place it in a very lucrative and competitive position.

The developer met with the man who owned the adjoining property and informed him of the proposed development plans. During their discussion, the man expressed concern about the increased traffic and noise from the subdivision. Thus, the parties orally agreed that the developer would contract with someone to erect a brick wall between their respective properties, and that the man would reimburse the developer for half the expenses the developer incurred in having the wall erected. Thereafter, the developer hired a mason to erect the wall for $10,000. The developer explained to the mason that the wall was being built between his property and the man's. He further advised the mason that although he (the developer) would be paying the mason the $10,000, the man had agreed to reimburse the developer for half the price.

The homeowner received notice that her uncle had passed away and left her a two-story mansion in a neighboring city. The homeowner decided to move her primary residence to the mansion and rent the ranch-style home. She entered into a one- year written lease agreement with a tenant. The agreement set the monthly rent at $1,000. Shortly after the tenant took possession of the home, he built, at his own expense, a room addition onto the home. The room addition increased the appraised market value of the home from $200,000 to $250,000. At the expiration of the lease, the homeowner informed the tenant that she had decided to sell the home. She offered the tenant the first opportunity to buy the home, but the tenant replied that he could not afford to do so. The tenant did claim that he should be entitled to compensation for the room addition, since it had increased the value of the home, and the homeowner agreed. The tenant and the homeowner then executed the following agreement:\"On the sale of the ranch-style home, the homeowner hereby promises to pay the tenant one- half of any sale proceeds in excess of $200,000, in compensation of the tenant's efforts in constructing the room addition onto the home. In addition, it is hereby agreed that the tenant may remain on the land until the sale is finalized, at a monthly rent of$500. ,'The homeowner initially set the asking price at $250,000, but received no offers to purchase the home. The homeowner decided to reduce the price to $210,000. This price reduction so infuriated the tenant that he thereafter made negative comments about the home to all of the prospective buyers who visited the home. Two months later, the homeowner sold the home to a buyer for $206,000. The buyer had visited the home while the tenant was away on a business trip and therefore did not hear the tenant's negative comments. Thereupon, the tenant, who had paid no rent for the final two months, moved out. After the sale was finalized, the homeowner refused to pay the tenant any of the sale proceeds. Which of the following statements, if true, most persuasively supports the tenant's contention that he is entitled to recover at least $4,000 from the owner (or the equivalent of one-half of the sale proceeds in excess of $200,000, minus two months' unpaid rent at $500 per month)? Choices: I. The owner breached an implied promise by failing to attempt to sell the property at $250,000, which was the appraised market value of the home.  | II. Even if the tenant's failure to pay any rent for the last two months was a material breach of contract, the owner's promise to pay the tenant a share of the proceeds of the sale was an independent covenant.  | III. The agreement between the homeowner that the tenant contained only one express condition (i. e. , the tenant was permitted to remain in the home during the owner's efforts to sell it), and since that condition has occurred, the tenant is entitled to his share of the proceeds from the sale.  | IV. Since the tenant made no negative comments about the home to the buyer, there is no showing that the tenant's remarks to the other prospective buyers necessarily caused any loss to the owner (i. e. , prevented her from selling the home for more than $210,000).  Answer:\nIV.

The tenant established a hardware store on the first floor and equipped the second floor as an apartment in which he lived with his wife and children. The two floors were connected by an outside wooden staircase with a handrail. The staircase was in a dilapidated condition at the time the tenant entered into the leasehold agreement.

They had been employed by the casino for four years. One day, they were unexpectedly fired by the casino's new manager. Apparently, the casino hired the new manager to get rid of some of the old-time employees and replace them with new personnel at a lower wage. Angered by their firing, the codefendants vowed to get back at the casino. As their revenge, they decided to plant a bomb in the casino and demand $1,000,000. After receiving the money, they would then reveal the location of the bomb and provide details for defusing it. The co-defendants agreed that the casino should be given adequate warning so that nobody would be injured. In accordance with their plan, one of the co-defendants, who was an electronics expert, built the bomb himself. He alone then drove to the casino where he placed the bomb in a hallway closet. Shortly thereafter, the other co-defendant phoned the casino and made a demand for the money. He said a bomb was in the casino and that it would explode in 24 hours unless the money was paid. The casino treated their demand as a crank call and refused to make any payment. With their plans having gone awry, the codefendants agreed that one of them should return to the casino and defuse the bomb. As one of the co-defendants was driving back to the casino, the bomb exploded, killing 30 people. A subsequent investigation revealed that a faulty wire caused the bomb to detonate prematurely.

The homeowner received notice that her uncle had passed away and left her a two-story mansion in a neighboring city. The homeowner decided to move her primary residence to the mansion and rent the ranch-style home. She entered into a one- year written lease agreement with a tenant. The agreement set the monthly rent at $1,000. Shortly after the tenant took possession of the home, he built, at his own expense, a room addition onto the home. The room addition increased the appraised market value of the home from $200,000 to $250,000. At the expiration of the lease, the homeowner informed the tenant that she had decided to sell the home. She offered the tenant the first opportunity to buy the home, but the tenant replied that he could not afford to do so. The tenant did claim that he should be entitled to compensation for the room addition, since it had increased the value of the home, and the homeowner agreed. The tenant and the homeowner then executed the following agreement:\"On the sale of the ranch-style home, the homeowner hereby promises to pay the tenant one- half of any sale proceeds in excess of $200,000, in compensation of the tenant's efforts in constructing the room addition onto the home. In addition, it is hereby agreed that the tenant may remain on the land until the sale is finalized, at a monthly rent of$500. ,'The homeowner initially set the asking price at $250,000, but received no offers to purchase the home. The homeowner decided to reduce the price to $210,000. This price reduction so infuriated the tenant that he thereafter made negative comments about the home to all of the prospective buyers who visited the home. Two months later, the homeowner sold the home to a buyer for $206,000. The buyer had visited the home while the tenant was away on a business trip and therefore did not hear the tenant's negative comments. Thereupon, the tenant, who had paid no rent for the final two months, moved out. After the sale was finalized, the homeowner refused to pay the tenant any of the sale proceeds. Which of the following statements, if true, most persuasively supports the tenant's contention that he is entitled to recover at least $4,000 from the owner (or the equivalent of one-half of the sale proceeds in excess of $200,000, minus two months' unpaid rent at $500 per month)? Choices: I. The owner breached an implied promise by failing to attempt to sell the property at $250,000, which was the appraised market value of the home.  | II. Even if the tenant's failure to pay any rent for the last two months was a material breach of contract, the owner's promise to pay the tenant a share of the proceeds of the sale was an independent covenant.  | III. The agreement between the homeowner that the tenant contained only one express condition (i. e. , the tenant was permitted to remain in the home during the owner's efforts to sell it), and since that condition has occurred, the tenant is entitled to his share of the proceeds from the sale.  | IV. Since the tenant made no negative comments about the home to the buyer, there is no showing that the tenant's remarks to the other prospective buyers necessarily caused any loss to the owner (i. e. , prevented her from selling the home for more than $210,000).

The statute authorized pari-mutuel betting at certain track locations within the state. A seven-member commission was established and empowered to supervise and regulate the sport's activities. Under an inseparable provision of the statute, the commission was authorized to suspend the racing license of any trainer whose horse tested positive for illegal drugs. The statute permitted the commission to make the suspension without any prior hearing. However, suspended trainers were entitled to a prompt post- suspension hearing and decision on any issues in dispute. The racing season was inaugurated at the largest racetrack in the state. The featured race was a $1,000,000 harness race for 2-year-old trotters. After the awards presentation, the winning horse underwent a standard drug test and traces of cocaine were found in his urine sample. Immediately thereafter, the horse was disqualified and the commission suspended the horse's trainer, without a prior hearing. Without seeking a post-suspension hearing as provided by statute, the trainer brings suit in federal district court challenging the constitutionality of the state harness racing law. The statute is probably Choices: I. unconstitutional, because the suspension provision unreasonably interferes with a trainer's right to contract with horse owners and seek gainful employment.  | II. constitutional, because being granted a racing license is a privilege, not a right.  | III. constitutional, because the state's interest in suspending the license of horse trainers suspected of illegal drugging is sufficiently important to permit the suspension of any prior hearing.  | IV. unconstitutional, because the suspension provision violates due process by not affording a prior hearing.  Answer:\nIII. constitutional, because the state's interest in suspending the license of horse trainers suspected of illegal drugging is sufficiently important to permit the suspension of any prior hearing. \n\nQuestion: [question] Choices: [choices] Answer: [answer]\nQuestion: An elderly man died with a will that had the following clause: \"After payment of such debts and funeral expenses, I give and bequeath to my beloved wife the farm on which we now reside and all my personal property, so long as she remains my widow.\" The wife retained the property and did not remarry. Some years prior to her death, she conveyed a deed in fee simple to her oldest son. After her death, her youngest son filed a claim against the estate contending that the father's will devised only a life estate to his wife. A state statute said that a fee simple would be presumed where the intent of the testator did not clearly show an intent to devise a lesser estate. The lower court held that the widow had received a defeasible fee conditioned on her remaining a widow. Because she did not marry, the deed to the son ripened into an indefeasible fee absolute at the time of conveyance. The younger son appealed. Will the appellate court likely reverse the lower court's decision and rule that the oldest son did not receive full title to the property? Choices: I. No, the deed superseded anything that was stated in the will because she was still alive when she conveyed title to her oldest son. | II. Yes, because it was a life estate that ends on her remarriage or death, with a remainder over to all of the sons. | III. Yes, the deed could not convey more than a life estate because of the condition in the will. | IV. No, because the will devises a fee simple that was defeasible if she had remarried; the title and the deed ripened into an indefeasible fee simple when she conveyed the property. Answer:\nIV. No, because the will devises a fee simple that was defeasible if she had remarried; the title and the deed ripened into an indefeasible fee simple when she conveyed the property.\n\nQuestion: [question] Choices: [choices] Answer: [answer]\nQuestion: A patient filed a medical malpractice action against a hospital in federal court, alleging that hospital staff had failed to diagnose the patient's cancer based on an X-ray that had been taken at the hospital.

He sued the manufacturer in federal court. At trial, the defendants filed a motion to preclude the report and testimony of the plaintiff's expert under Fed.R.Evid. 702. The defendants claim bias, lack of scientific support, failure to conduct testing, divergence of opinion among experts, and that the expert was trained for large commercial fires. The expert had investigated over 500 fires, wrote a book that was used in courses nationwide and taught a course in forensic fire investigations in a university. Her report ruled out all other possible causes. The court did a gate-keeping review as required by Rule 702 and ruled that the expert was highly qualified and that she used accepted scientific methodologies in arriving at her opinion. The defendants appealed the ruling. Is the appellate court likely to go against the ruling under these facts? Choices: I. No, the court has absolute discretion in deciding the competency of the expert for purposes of giving expert trial testimony and evidence. | II. No, the court did the required gate-keeping inquiry and found that the witness was not only qualified and competent, but also used the accepted methodologies. | III.

On behalf of his company, he borrowed $500,000 from a credit union for this purpose. The company was to repay the loan at the rate of $2,500 per month. The loan was secured by a mortgage on the building that housed the company's operation center. Eight months later, the company's sales started to drop and the company began experiencing cash flow problems. As a result, the company failed to make its loan payments for three consecutive months, causing the credit union to threaten to foreclose on the mortgage. The president's father, a retired wealthy investor, then intervened on behalf of the company, paid the three missed loan payments, and told the credit union that if they would refrain from any legal action against the company for a year, he would personally see that the debt was paid. The credit union orally agreed to the father's surety arrangement. However, it was never reduced to writing. Six months later, the company once again missed consecutive payments, and the credit union filed a foreclosure suit against the company. The father did not learn of the suit until a week later, but he raised no objection, since he thought the credit union was violating its agreement with him by foreclosing within the one-year period, thus relieving him of his part of the bargain. Two weeks later, the credit union's loan officer called the father and said that the credit union would hold off on the foreclosure suit as per their agreement, since the company had just made a new technological development that would place it in a very lucrative and competitive position.

Due to the precipitous drop in oil prices, many oil companies have been forced to cut back on oil production and lay off many workers. As a result, unemployment has reached all-time high levels in several states. In order to alleviate this potentially catastrophic situation, the one of those state's legislatures recently enacted a statute requiring that 10% of all oil produced within the state be purchased by the state and reserved for use by state residents. The purpose of the statute was twofold: (1) it was intended to stimulate the oil industry within the state by encouraging more production and exploration, and (2) it was designed to create an oil reserve so that state residents and industries would not suffer unduly from future oil shortages. Subsequently, Congress enacted a statute forbidding states to reserve local resources for local use in this manner. Is this state statute constitutional? Choices: I. No, because application of the statute denies non-oil producing companies to equal protection of the law, in violation of the Fourteenth Amendment.  | II.

The homeowner was busy, however, and would not have time to make a trip to the store for several days; so he put the vacuum cleaner in a corner in his living room to store it until he had a chance to take it to the store. The next day, the homeowner had an old friend from out of town arrive for a three-day visit. The homeowner had a spare room and loved to have overnight guests, so he had invited this old friend to come for a visit and was excited to see her. Shortly after the guest's arrival, however, the homeowner had to go to work for a few hours, so he told his friend to make herself comfortable in the house while he went to his office.

The home would house 200 beds for persons needing nursing home care for the remainder of their lives. The state government approved the request and certified the need for more nursing homes in that township. The township, however, vehemently opposed permitting a nursing home in a residential zoning district and refused the building permit. The township's zoning law has 15 residential zones, each of which does not allow a nursing home.

The man was convicted of selling large quantities of an illegal drug from his house. Acting under a state law authorizing the destruction of buildings that are used for illegal activity, the city destroyed the man\u00d5s house. The man\u00d5s family then rented an apartment and demanded that the city pay the rent for that temporary residence. The family relied on a state law providing that any person who was dispossessed of his or her place of residence because of the actions of city officials was entitled to replacement housing at the city\u00d5s expense until permanent substitute housing could be found. When the city refused to pay the rent for the apartment, the man\u00d5s family sued the city in a state trial court claiming a right to such payment under both the state law and the due process clause of the Fourteenth Amendment to the United States Constitution. The highest state court ruled for the family. Although the court decided that the family had no right to payment under the state law, it held that the Fourteenth Amendment entitled the family to payment of the rent for the temporary apart-ment. In its opinion, the highest state court indicated that in several of its decisions it had found cities liable for compen-sation in similar situations on the basis of the due process clause of the state constitution. But the highest state court declined to base its holding on the state constitution because that issue had not been properly raised in the case.

Yes, because the highest state court based its decision wholly on federal law grounds. | II. No, because independent state law grounds could have been used to justify the result in this case. | III.

He decided to dig out the lawn in his back yard and turn the space into a swampy marsh. Eventually, his back yard was filled with tall grasses, reeds, and other marsh plants. A wide variety of frogs, turtles, snakes, birds, and other animals inhabited the yard. The ground was usually covered by several inches of standing water. The environmentalist's neighbors were not pleased with the condition of the environmentalist's yard. They complained that it produced foul odors, and they claimed that the standing water was a breeding ground for mosquitoes and other insects. Several months after the environmentalist converted his yard into a marsh, a real estate investor purchased the house closest to the environmentalist's back yard swamp. The investor lived in a large city several hundred miles away, and he purchased the house next to the environmentalist's for investment purposes.

On behalf of his company, he borrowed $500,000 from a credit union for this purpose. The company was to repay the loan at the rate of $2,500 per month. The loan was secured by a mortgage on the building that housed the company's operation center. Eight months later, the company's sales started to drop and the company began experiencing cash flow problems. As a result, the company failed to make its loan payments for three consecutive months, causing the credit union to threaten to foreclose on the mortgage. The president's father, a retired wealthy investor, then intervened on behalf of the company, paid the three missed loan payments, and told the credit union that if they would refrain from any legal action against the company for a year, he would personally see that the debt was paid. The credit union orally agreed to the father's surety arrangement. However, it was never reduced to writing. Six months later, the company once again missed consecutive payments, and the credit union filed a foreclosure suit against the company. The father did not learn of the suit until a week later, but he raised no objection, since he thought the credit union was violating its agreement with him by foreclosing within the one-year period, thus relieving him of his part of the bargain. Two weeks later, the credit union's loan officer called the father and said that the credit union would hold off on the foreclosure suit as per their agreement, since the company had just made a new technological development that would place it in a very lucrative and competitive position.

The original note, however, had limited bank's recourse to $50,000 or higher. There was no response and the bank entered a deficiency judgment for $10,000. When it started execution proceedings to collect the $10,000, the defendants entered a defense, arguing that the bank was limited to recourse of $50,000 or higher. The judgment for $10,000 was therefore void and unenforceable. Will the court allow enforcement of the deficiency judgment for $10,000? Choices: I. Yes, the court will enforce the judgment because the limitation in the original note is voidable, due to the mortgagors' breach of the mortgage terms. | II.

The statute authorized pari-mutuel betting at certain track locations within the state. A seven-member commission was established and empowered to supervise and regulate the sport's activities. Under an inseparable provision of the statute, the commission was authorized to suspend the racing license of any trainer whose horse tested positive for illegal drugs. The statute permitted the commission to make the suspension without any prior hearing. However, suspended trainers were entitled to a prompt post- suspension hearing and decision on any issues in dispute. The racing season was inaugurated at the largest racetrack in the state. The featured race was a $1,000,000 harness race for 2-year-old trotters. After the awards presentation, the winning horse underwent a standard drug test and traces of cocaine were found in his urine sample. Immediately thereafter, the horse was disqualified and the commission suspended the horse's trainer, without a prior hearing. Without seeking a post-suspension hearing as provided by statute, the trainer brings suit in federal district court challenging the constitutionality of the state harness racing law. The statute is probably Choices: I. unconstitutional, because the suspension provision unreasonably interferes with a trainer's right to contract with horse owners and seek gainful employment.  | II. constitutional, because being granted a racing license is a privilege, not a right.  | III. constitutional, because the state's interest in suspending the license of horse trainers suspected of illegal drugging is sufficiently important to permit the suspension of any prior hearing.  | IV. unconstitutional, because the suspension provision violates due process by not affording a prior hearing.

The homeowner received notice that her uncle had passed away and left her a two-story mansion in a neighboring city. The homeowner decided to move her primary residence to the mansion and rent the ranch-style home. She entered into a one- year written lease agreement with a tenant. The agreement set the monthly rent at $1,000. Shortly after the tenant took possession of the home, he built, at his own expense, a room addition onto the home. The room addition increased the appraised market value of the home from $200,000 to $250,000. At the expiration of the lease, the homeowner informed the tenant that she had decided to sell the home. She offered the tenant the first opportunity to buy the home, but the tenant replied that he could not afford to do so. The tenant did claim that he should be entitled to compensation for the room addition, since it had increased the value of the home, and the homeowner agreed. The tenant and the homeowner then executed the following agreement:\"On the sale of the ranch-style home, the homeowner hereby promises to pay the tenant one- half of any sale proceeds in excess of $200,000, in compensation of the tenant's efforts in constructing the room addition onto the home. In addition, it is hereby agreed that the tenant may remain on the land until the sale is finalized, at a monthly rent of$500. ,'The homeowner initially set the asking price at $250,000, but received no offers to purchase the home. The homeowner decided to reduce the price to $210,000. This price reduction so infuriated the tenant that he thereafter made negative comments about the home to all of the prospective buyers who visited the home. Two months later, the homeowner sold the home to a buyer for $206,000. The buyer had visited the home while the tenant was away on a business trip and therefore did not hear the tenant's negative comments. Thereupon, the tenant, who had paid no rent for the final two months, moved out. After the sale was finalized, the homeowner refused to pay the tenant any of the sale proceeds. Which of the following statements, if true, most persuasively supports the tenant's contention that he is entitled to recover at least $4,000 from the owner (or the equivalent of one-half of the sale proceeds in excess of $200,000, minus two months' unpaid rent at $500 per month)? Choices: I. The owner breached an implied promise by failing to attempt to sell the property at $250,000, which was the appraised market value of the home.  | II. Even if the tenant's failure to pay any rent for the last two months was a material breach of contract, the owner's promise to pay the tenant a share of the proceeds of the sale was an independent covenant.  | III. The agreement between the homeowner that the tenant contained only one express condition (i. e. , the tenant was permitted to remain in the home during the owner's efforts to sell it), and since that condition has occurred, the tenant is entitled to his share of the proceeds from the sale.  | IV. Since the tenant made no negative comments about the home to the buyer, there is no showing that the tenant's remarks to the other prospective buyers necessarily caused any loss to the owner (i. e. , prevented her from selling the home for more than $210,000).  Answer:\nIV.

Which of the following is the best argument the state can make for the continued validity of its law?  Choices: I. The law is unaffected by the federal statute, because Congress did not expressly prohibit state laws requiring power equipment to meet specified levels of fuel efficiency. | II.

Some years prior to her death, she conveyed a deed in fee simple to her oldest son. After her death, her youngest son filed a claim against the estate contending that the father's will devised only a life estate to his wife. A state statute said that a fee simple would be presumed where the intent of the testator did not clearly show an intent to devise a lesser estate. The lower court held that the widow had received a defeasible fee conditioned on her remaining a widow. Because she did not marry, the deed to the son ripened into an indefeasible fee absolute at the time of conveyance. The younger son appealed. Will the appellate court likely reverse the lower court's decision and rule that the oldest son did not receive full title to the property? Choices: I. No, the deed superseded anything that was stated in the will because she was still alive when she conveyed title to her oldest son. | II. Yes, because it was a life estate that ends on her remarriage or death, with a remainder over to all of the sons. | III. Yes, the deed could not convey more than a life estate because of the condition in the will. | IV. No, because the will devises a fee simple that was defeasible if she had remarried; the title and the deed ripened into an indefeasible fee simple when she conveyed the property. Answer:\nIV.

The treaty was ratified by the Senate. Recently, the President, angry over Mexico's perceived failure to abide by the terms of the treaty, has decided that the United States would not honor any of the terms of the treaty.

Acting under a state law authorizing the destruction of buildings that are used for illegal activity, the city destroyed the man\u00d5s house. The man\u00d5s family then rented an apartment and demanded that the city pay the rent for that temporary residence. The family relied on a state law providing that any person who was dispossessed of his or her place of residence because of the actions of city officials was entitled to replacement housing at the city\u00d5s expense until permanent substitute housing could be found. When the city refused to pay the rent for the apartment, the man\u00d5s family sued the city in a state trial court claiming a right to such payment under both the state law and the due process clause of the Fourteenth Amendment to the United States Constitution. The highest state court ruled for the family. Although the court decided that the family had no right to payment under the state law, it held that the Fourteenth Amendment entitled the family to payment of the rent for the temporary apart-ment. In its opinion, the highest state court indicated that in several of its decisions it had found cities liable for compen-sation in similar situations on the basis of the due process clause of the state constitution.

To accomplish this goal, he delivered to his attorney a deed that fully complied with the applicable statute of frauds and told his attorney to record the deed when he died unless he later gave the attorney instructions to the contrary. Three weeks after dropping off the deed, the man properly drafted and executed his own will, which left all of his real property to his son.

Several years later, at a time when the woman still owed the bank $750,000 on the mortgage loan, she sold the farm to a man for $900,000. The man paid the woman $150,000 in cash and specifically assumed the mortgage note. The bank received notice of this transaction and elected not to exer-cise the optional due-on-sale clause in the mortgage. Without informing the man, the bank later released the woman from any further personal liability on the note. After he had owned the farm for a number of years, the man defaulted on the loan. The bank properly accelerated the loan, and the farm was eventually sold at a foreclosure sale for $500,000. Because there was still $600,000 owing on the note, the bank sued the man for the $100,000 deficiency. Is the man liable to the bank for the deficiency? Choices: I. No, because the bank\u00d5s release of the woman from per-sonal liability also released the man. | II. Yes, because the bank\u00d5s release of the woman consti-tuted a clogging of the equity of redemption. | III.

The plant had been shut down for 10 years. Much to Darlene's chagrin, officials at the plant had announced plans to reopen the plant. Darlene, who was a waitress at a local restaurant, devised a scheme whereby she would contaminate oysters at her restaurant with small amounts of a poisonous substance. Although she didn't want to seriously injure anyone, Darlene believed that if some people got sick from eating the oysters, they would attribute their illness to nuclear waste from the power plant. To facilitate her plan, she stole some poison from a local pharmacy. She sprinkled it on some oysters at the restaurant where she worked. Mistakenly, she put too much of the poison on some of the oysters. A few of the customers who ate the oysters became sick and nauseated. One person suffered convulsions and died from the poisoning. A statute in the jurisdiction provides: \"Any intentional and premeditated killing, or one occurring during the perpetration of a felony, is murder in the first degree. Murder in the second degree is murder with intent to cause serious bodily harm. Manslaughter is an unlawful killing due to recklessness. \"Assault with intent to kill or to cause serious physical injury is a felony in the jurisdiction. There are no separate felonies relating to adulterating food or poisoning.

The home would house 200 beds for persons needing nursing home care for the remainder of their lives. The state government approved the request and certified the need for more nursing homes in that township. The township, however, vehemently opposed permitting a nursing home in a residential zoning district and refused the building permit. The township's zoning law has 15 residential zones, each of which does not allow a nursing home. The nursing home sued in federal court requesting declaratory and injunctive relief on the basis that the zoning law was discriminatory against handicapped persons and a violation of federal law. Will the court compel the township to allow the construction of the nursing home? Choices: I. No, it is strictly a matter of local preference whether a particular use will be allowed in a zoning district. | II. Yes, the zoning law represents an unconstitutional denial of substantive due process to handicapped persons. | III. Yes, under federal law all municipalities must provide reasonable accommodations to handicapped persons, and the zoning law in question violates that mandate. | IV.

Due to the precipitous drop in oil prices, many oil companies have been forced to cut back on oil production and lay off many workers. As a result, unemployment has reached all-time high levels in several states. In order to alleviate this potentially catastrophic situation, the one of those state's legislatures recently enacted a statute requiring that 10% of all oil produced within the state be purchased by the state and reserved for use by state residents. The purpose of the statute was twofold: (1) it was intended to stimulate the oil industry within the state by encouraging more production and exploration, and (2) it was designed to create an oil reserve so that state residents and industries would not suffer unduly from future oil shortages. Subsequently, Congress enacted a statute forbidding states to reserve local resources for local use in this manner. Is this state statute constitutional? Choices: I. No, because application of the statute denies non-oil producing companies to equal protection of the law, in violation of the Fourteenth Amendment.  | II. Yes, because Congress has not expressly forbidden states to reserve local resources for local use.  | III. No, because a state may not protect its residents from out-of-state competition for its natural resources without the express permission of Congress.  | IV. Yes, because the state statute requires that the oil be used for the general welfare of the people in emergency situations.  Answer:\nIII. No, because a state may not protect its residents from out-of-state competition for its natural resources without the express permission of Congress. \n\nQuestion: [question] Choices: [choices] Answer: [answer]\nQuestion: A man, a teenager, and a woman are siblings who inherited their father's farm when he died testate, leaving his farm to his children as joint tenants. Soon after the father's death, the teenager died and the woman moved to another part of the country. The man has not heard from the woman in many years. Prior to their father's death, the man and the teenager operated their father's farm. They continued doing so after their father died, sharing all expenses equally and dividing the profits between them. Following the teenager's death, the man has continued to operate the farm for his sole benefit. Recently, the man has granted a coal company rights to strip-mine coal from underneath the farm. Their agreement stipulated that the coal company would pay the man a per-ton royalty for the coal extracted. In addition, the coal company agreed to fill in the excavated area and replace top soil on the surface of the land. During the coal company's strip-mining operation, the woman returns to the farm and demands a proportionate share of the royalties paid to her brother (the man). Which of the following is the LEAST accurate statement regarding the woman's right to share in the royalties? Choices: I. It would be inequitable for one concurrent owner to receive an unapportionate share of the royalties. | II. The woman's redomiciling constituted a severance of the joint tenancy, which resulted in a destruction of her interest in the mining royalties.  | III. As a joint tenant, the woman would be entitled to contribution for a proportionate share of the royalties.  | IV.

He picked up a portable television set that was lying on the sidewalk and started to walk off quickly. A police officer who was standing in front of the shop rushed after the defendant and arrested him. The defendant, an indigent, was charged with grand larceny, a felony carrying the maximum penalty of seven months imprisonment and a S 1,000 fine. At his arraignment, the judge advised the defendant of his right to have counsel appointed for him. The defendant, however, told the judge that he wanted to represent himself and waive his right to a jury trial. The judge then questioned the defendant at length about his demands. The defendant indicated that he had no previous legal experience. He told the judge that the reason he didn't want a court-appointed attorney to represent him was because he didn't trust lawyers.

Some years prior to her death, she conveyed a deed in fee simple to her oldest son. After her death, her youngest son filed a claim against the estate contending that the father's will devised only a life estate to his wife. A state statute said that a fee simple would be presumed where the intent of the testator did not clearly show an intent to devise a lesser estate. The lower court held that the widow had received a defeasible fee conditioned on her remaining a widow. Because she did not marry, the deed to the son ripened into an indefeasible fee absolute at the time of conveyance. The younger son appealed. Will the appellate court likely reverse the lower court's decision and rule that the oldest son did not receive full title to the property? Choices: I. No, the deed superseded anything that was stated in the will because she was still alive when she conveyed title to her oldest son. | II. Yes, because it was a life estate that ends on her remarriage or death, with a remainder over to all of the sons. | III. Yes, the deed could not convey more than a life estate because of the condition in the will. | IV.

There is a provision of the statute that does permit breweries to distribute beer to bars, taverns, and restaurants in kegs for \"on-site\" consumption by patrons.

While Ann was away on a business trip, someone broke into her garage and stole her golf clubs. The next week, Ann was planning to go on vacation and asked Bea if she could borrow her golf clubs. Bea agreed and loaned her golf clubs to Ann, who promised to return them after her vacation. When Ann returned home, she kept the golf clubs and continued to use them. A few weeks later, Bea was having dinner with Carla and learned that Carla owed Ann $4,000. Carla had just been laid off from her job and did not have the money to repay Ann. Bea told Carla that she would contact Ann and make arrangements to repay the loan on her behalf. Thereupon, Ann and Bea entered into a written agreement wherein Bea promised to pay Ann, at a rate of $400 a month, the matured $4,000 debt that Carla owed Ann. In the same written instrument, Ann promised to return Bea's golf clubs, which she still had in her possession. Ann, however, made no written or oral. commitment to forbear to sue Carla to collect the $4,000 debt; and Bea made no oral or written request for any such forbearance. After this agreement between Ann and Bea was signed and executed, Ann promptly returned the golf clubs to Bea. For the next six months, Bea made and Ann accepted the $400 monthly payments as agreed. During that period, Ann, in fact, did forbear to take any legal action against Carla. However, Bea then repudiated her agreement with Ann, and 30 days later Ann filed a contract action against Bea. Assume that the applicable statute of limitations on Ann's antecedent claim against Carla expired the day before Ann filed her contract action against Bea. Which of the following is the most persuasive argument that Bea is not liable to Ann under the terms of their written agreement? Choices: I. Since the written agreement between Bea and Ann shows a gross imbalance between the values of the promises exchanged, the consideration for Bea's promise was legally insufficient to support it. | II. Since Ann had a pre-existing duty to return Bea's golf clubs to her when the agreement between Ann and Bea was made, there was no consideration for Bea's promise to Ann. | III. Since Carla, when the agreement between Ann and Bea was made, had a pre-existing duty to repay the $4,000 debt to Ann, there was no consideration for Bea's promise to Ann. | IV. Since Ann did not expressly promise to forbear to sue Carla to collect the antecedent $4,000 debt, Ann's forbearance for six months could not constitute consideration for Bea's promise.

Once he obtains the money, he thinks it might be good to let a candle drop and have the whole building burn down. While he is out at lunch, the janitorial staff came through his office. While cleaning the area, one person lit a candle on the man's desk. When they left, he forgot to blow it out. They slammed the door on the way out, causing the lit candle to fall. It started a fire that burned the building down. What crime, if any, is the man most likely to be convicted of? Choices: I. Attempted arson and attempted murder.

A new federal statute requires all power equipment, including lawn mowers, to be labeled with energy efficiency stickers to permit purchasers to make informed choices when buying such equipment. The statute does not expressly preempt state law. Assume that no other federal statute or administrative regulation addresses the energy efficiency of power equipment. Which of the following is the best argument the state can make for the continued validity of its law?  Choices: I. The law is unaffected by the federal statute, because Congress did not expressly prohibit state laws requiring power equipment to meet specified levels of fuel efficiency. | II. The purpose of the law is consistent with the purpose of the federal statute, enforcement of the law would not interfere with the full execution of the statute, and there is no evidence that Congress intended to preclude the states from enacting supplemental laws on this subject. | III. There is a very strong presumption that a specific state law on a subject normally within the state's police power prevails over a more general federal statute, because the Tenth Amendment reserves to the states primary authority over matters affecting public health, welfare, and safety. | IV. Congress cannot preempt state laws requiring a specified minimum level of requiring a specified minimum level of fuel efficiency for lawn mowers, because the use of such equipment is a wholly local event and, therefore, is beyond the regulatory authority vested in Congress by the commerce clause.

Although it is not the only lake in the county, it is the largest and most scenic, and it attracts visitors from miles around. One of its biggest assets is the excellent fishing and boating, which is available to the public at large. Three years ago, in order to enhance the recreational aspects of the lake, the county leased a sizable portion of the lake and surrounding parkland to a company owned by the most prominent family in the county. The lease required the company to construct and operate a first-rate yacht house and club, complete with bar, restaurant, and private marina, and to pay the county 10% of its net profits as rent. The company set up bylaws, which were reviewed and approved by the county at the time the lease was negotiated. According to the bylaws, the yacht club, complete with its restaurant and bar, would be open to members only, and the membership committee was empowered to set up strict membership \"standards,\" as well as the cost of membership fees and dues. Upon completion of the facilities, the state granted the company a license to sell alcoholic beverages in its restaurant and bar. The membership committee announced that the membership fee was $5,000 and the monthly dues $75. Furthermore, the membership committee had a policy of approving only membership applications from men, while disapproving and denying all applications from women.

The homeowner received notice that her uncle had passed away and left her a two-story mansion in a neighboring city. The homeowner decided to move her primary residence to the mansion and rent the ranch-style home. She entered into a one- year written lease agreement with a tenant. The agreement set the monthly rent at $1,000. Shortly after the tenant took possession of the home, he built, at his own expense, a room addition onto the home. The room addition increased the appraised market value of the home from $200,000 to $250,000. At the expiration of the lease, the homeowner informed the tenant that she had decided to sell the home. She offered the tenant the first opportunity to buy the home, but the tenant replied that he could not afford to do so. The tenant did claim that he should be entitled to compensation for the room addition, since it had increased the value of the home, and the homeowner agreed. The tenant and the homeowner then executed the following agreement:\"On the sale of the ranch-style home, the homeowner hereby promises to pay the tenant one- half of any sale proceeds in excess of $200,000, in compensation of the tenant's efforts in constructing the room addition onto the home. In addition, it is hereby agreed that the tenant may remain on the land until the sale is finalized, at a monthly rent of$500. ,'The homeowner initially set the asking price at $250,000, but received no offers to purchase the home. The homeowner decided to reduce the price to $210,000. This price reduction so infuriated the tenant that he thereafter made negative comments about the home to all of the prospective buyers who visited the home. Two months later, the homeowner sold the home to a buyer for $206,000. The buyer had visited the home while the tenant was away on a business trip and therefore did not hear the tenant's negative comments. Thereupon, the tenant, who had paid no rent for the final two months, moved out. After the sale was finalized, the homeowner refused to pay the tenant any of the sale proceeds. Which of the following statements, if true, most persuasively supports the tenant's contention that he is entitled to recover at least $4,000 from the owner (or the equivalent of one-half of the sale proceeds in excess of $200,000, minus two months' unpaid rent at $500 per month)? Choices: I. The owner breached an implied promise by failing to attempt to sell the property at $250,000, which was the appraised market value of the home.  | II. Even if the tenant's failure to pay any rent for the last two months was a material breach of contract, the owner's promise to pay the tenant a share of the proceeds of the sale was an independent covenant.  | III. The agreement between the homeowner that the tenant contained only one express condition (i. e. , the tenant was permitted to remain in the home during the owner's efforts to sell it), and since that condition has occurred, the tenant is entitled to his share of the proceeds from the sale.  | IV. Since the tenant made no negative comments about the home to the buyer, there is no showing that the tenant's remarks to the other prospective buyers necessarily caused any loss to the owner (i. e. , prevented her from selling the home for more than $210,000).  Answer:\nIV.

Avery designed a computer program that secretly moves small amounts of bank money, undetectable as individual transactions, into a secret account to eventually aggregate into a hefty nest egg. Hewlett installed the program; Packard set up the secret account. The three bankers meet periodically to check the account, but they have not yet built up enough of a balance to make a withdrawal.

Hewlett pulls Mac into a bank vault room and warns, \"You'd better be quiet about this or you're gonna get it.\" Packard gets wind of the threat and decides things have gone too far. Packard closes the account and goes to the police station, where he tells an inspector the whole story. Meanwhile, Avery secretly \"borrows\" a bank computer to monitor the progress of his program from home. Impressed with how fast it downloads, Avery decides to keep the bank's computer.
