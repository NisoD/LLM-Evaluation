Due to the precipitous drop in oil prices, many oil companies have been forced to cut back on oil production and lay off many workers. As a result, unemployment has reached all-time high levels in several states. In order to alleviate this potentially catastrophic situation, the one of those state's legislatures recently enacted a statute requiring that 10% of all oil produced within the state be purchased by the state and reserved for use by state residents. The purpose of the statute was twofold: (1) it was intended to stimulate the oil industry within the state by encouraging more production and exploration, and (2) it was designed to create an oil reserve so that state residents and industries would not suffer unduly from future oil shortages. Subsequently, Congress enacted a statute forbidding states to reserve local resources for local use in this manner. Is this state statute constitutional? Choices: I. Yes, because Congress has not expressly forbidden states to reserve local resources for local use.  or II. Yes, because the state statute requires that the oil be used for the general welfare of the people in emergency situations.  or III. No, because a state may not protect its residents from out-of-state competition for its natural resources without the express permission of Congress.  or IV. No, because application of the statute denies non-oil producing companies to equal protection of the law, in violation of the Fourteenth Amendment.  Answer:\nIII.

The so-called installment land contract has been popular as a substitute for the mortgage or deed of trust. Under such a contract, the seller agrees to accept, and the buyer agrees to pay, the purchase price in installments over a stipulated period of time. The vendor retains legal title as security for the payment of the purchase price; and the vendee has equitable title under the doctrine of equitable conversion. The most important characteristic of the installment land contract, however, is the forfeiture clause, which provides that if the vendee is in default for 30 days, the vendor may, at his option, declare a forfeiture of the contract, in which case all payments made shall be forfeited as \"liquidated\" damages and the buyer shall become a tenant at will of the seller. Over the years, many sellers of property under such installment land contracts have declared forfeitures in situations where the prospective buyers were delinquent in their payments, even when the buyer was late with a single payment after nearly all the other payments had been made. In order to remedy this inequitable situation, the state legislature enacted a statute requiring any seller attempting to declare a forfeiture of an installment land contract to do so by instituting a formal foreclosure action in the courts. The new law also provided that prior to the commencement of such a foreclosure action, the seller under such an arrangement must give the buyer a 60-day grace period to make up any delinquent installment payment with interest. The new law expressly applied both to installment land contracts entered into subsequent to its enactment and to installment land contracts already in existence at the time of its enactment. Is this new state statute likely to be held constitutional? Choices: I. Yes, because it is a reasonable regulation of the procedure to be followed in such cases and does not substantially diminish the underlying obligations of the buyer. or II. Yes, because the authority to enact laws regulating real estate sales transactions occurring within the boundaries of individual states is reserved exclusively to the states by the Tenth Amendment. or III. No, because application of the law to installment land contracts entered into prior to its enactment is a violation of the obligation of contracts. or IV. No, because application of the law to installment land contracts entered into before or after its enactment is a deprivation of a proprietary interest without due process of the law.

The man\u00d5s family then rented an apartment and demanded that the city pay the rent for that temporary residence. The family relied on a state law providing that any person who was dispossessed of his or her place of residence because of the actions of city officials was entitled to replacement housing at the city\u00d5s expense until permanent substitute housing could be found.

In its opinion, the highest state court indicated that in several of its decisions it had found cities liable for compen-sation in similar situations on the basis of the due process clause of the state constitution.

The home would house 200 beds for persons needing nursing home care for the remainder of their lives. The state government approved the request and certified the need for more nursing homes in that township. The township, however, vehemently opposed permitting a nursing home in a residential zoning district and refused the building permit. The township's zoning law has 15 residential zones, each of which does not allow a nursing home. The nursing home sued in federal court requesting declaratory and injunctive relief on the basis that the zoning law was discriminatory against handicapped persons and a violation of federal law. Will the court compel the township to allow the construction of the nursing home? Choices: I. Yes, under federal law all municipalities must provide reasonable accommodations to handicapped persons, and the zoning law in question violates that mandate. or II. No, it is strictly a matter of local preference whether a particular use will be allowed in a zoning district. or III. No, because there are numerous other locations for nursing homes within the state, a local community's restriction against that use is not discriminatory. or IV. Yes, the zoning law represents an unconstitutional denial of substantive due process to handicapped persons. Answer:\nI. Yes, under federal law all municipalities must provide reasonable accommodations to handicapped persons, and the zoning law in question violates that mandate.\n\nQuestion: [question] Choices: [choices] Answer: [answer]\nQuestion: A baseball fan purchased two tickets for a World Series baseball game.

Several years later, at a time when the woman still owed the bank $750,000 on the mortgage loan, she sold the farm to a man for $900,000. The man paid the woman $150,000 in cash and specifically assumed the mortgage note.

Darlene, who was a waitress at a local restaurant, devised a scheme whereby she would contaminate oysters at her restaurant with small amounts of a poisonous substance. Although she didn't want to seriously injure anyone, Darlene believed that if some people got sick from eating the oysters, they would attribute their illness to nuclear waste from the power plant.

The boss died intestate on May 1, 2001, leaving her daughter as her sole heir. Following her mother's death, the daughter moved into the house on May 2, 2001. On June 1, 2001 the neighbor sold lot 2 to a professor by a deed that contained no mention of the driveway located on lot 1. The neighbor and the professor assumed that the latter had the right to use the driveway, so they didn't insert any recitations in their deed instrument regarding the driveway. Immediately upon her taking possession of the premises, the daughter began to use the driveway on lot 1. Consequently, she objected to the professor's use of the driveway.

The professor should Choices: I. win, because he acquired an implied easement to use the driveway as owner of the dominant tenement. or II. win, because the neighbor's easement to use the driveway was conveyed to the professor. or III. lose, because the Statute of Frauds was not satisfied. or IV. lose, because the neighbor's non-use of the driveway effectuated an abandonment of the easement.

The mushrooms on the farmer's farm were usually picked and packaged by the farmer's three sons. On February 27, two of the Sons were injured in a fanning accident and hospitalized. As a result, the farmer encountered a manpower shortage and could not process all of the mushrooms for the chef's order. On February 28, the farmer telephoned the chef and said, \"Because my two sons were injured yesterday, I won't be able to deliver your mushrooms on March 1. However, I am trying to hire some other farm hands to help process your order. Although I can't promise it, I should be able to deliver the mushrooms by the end of the week. \" The chef, who knew that the fanner's sons were responsible for the mushroom farming, said, \"No problem.

In accordance with the new law, all beer consumed within the state must be sold in aluminum cans that are recyclable. There is a provision of the statute that does permit breweries to distribute beer to bars, taverns, and restaurants in kegs for \"on-site\" consumption by patrons. Before the passage of the law, approximately 28% of all beer consumed in the state was packaged in glass bottles. Of that total, 75% of the beer was bottled outside the state, while 25% was bottled by companies in-state. The legislature passed the law at the strong urging of the aluminum can industry. It was estimated that one aluminum company alone spent over $5,000,000 in its lobbying campaign for the passage of the bill. Ironically, the new law even received strong support from environmentalists who believed that recyclable cans would help prevent littering and unsightly trash accumulation. The strongest federal constitutional argument against the validity of the law is that it violates the Choices: I. equal protection clause of the Fourteenth Amendment by discriminating against beer bottlers. or II. privileges or immunities clause of the Fourteenth Amendment by preventing out-of-state beer bottlers from conducting their business in the state. or III. commerce clause by violating the negative implications on interstate commerce. or IV. contracts clause by impairing the ability of beer bottlers to honor existing contracts for the sale of bottled beer in the state.

A new federal statute requires all power equipment, including lawn mowers, to be labeled with energy efficiency stickers to permit purchasers to make informed choices when buying such equipment. The statute does not expressly preempt state law. Assume that no other federal statute or administrative regulation addresses the energy efficiency of power equipment. Which of the following is the best argument the state can make for the continued validity of its law?  Choices: I. Congress cannot preempt state laws requiring a specified minimum level of requiring a specified minimum level of fuel efficiency for lawn mowers, because the use of such equipment is a wholly local event and, therefore, is beyond the regulatory authority vested in Congress by the commerce clause. or II. The law is unaffected by the federal statute, because Congress did not expressly prohibit state laws requiring power equipment to meet specified levels of fuel efficiency. or III. The purpose of the law is consistent with the purpose of the federal statute, enforcement of the law would not interfere with the full execution of the statute, and there is no evidence that Congress intended to preclude the states from enacting supplemental laws on this subject. or IV.

Several years later, at a time when the woman still owed the bank $750,000 on the mortgage loan, she sold the farm to a man for $900,000. The man paid the woman $150,000 in cash and specifically assumed the mortgage note. The bank received notice of this transaction and elected not to exer-cise the optional due-on-sale clause in the mortgage. Without informing the man, the bank later released the woman from any further personal liability on the note. After he had owned the farm for a number of years, the man defaulted on the loan. The bank properly accelerated the loan, and the farm was eventually sold at a foreclosure sale for $500,000. Because there was still $600,000 owing on the note, the bank sued the man for the $100,000 deficiency. Is the man liable to the bank for the deficiency? Choices: I. No, because the woman would have still been primarily liable for payment, but the bank had released her from personal liability. or II.

Specifically, the informant said that, two months before, he had visited the man's apartment with a friend and that on that occasion he saw the man sell his friend some heroin. The detective knew that the informant, the man, and the friend were acquaintances. Thereafter, the detective put all this information into affidavit form, appeared before a magistrate, and secured a search warrant for the man's apartment. The search turned up a supply of heroin. The man's motion to suppress introduction of the heroin into evidence will most probably be Choices: I. granted, because a search warrant cannot validly be issued solely on the basis of an informant's information.  or II. granted, because the information supplied to the detective concerned an occurrence too remote in time to justify a finding of probable cause at the time of the search.  or III. granted, because a search for mere evidence alone is improper and illegal.  or IV. denied, because the informant had proven himself reliable in the past, and the information he gave turned out to be correct.

The loan was secured by a mortgage on the corporation's plant and building site. When the debt came due, the corporation was short of ready cash and the bank threatened to foreclose. One of the shareholders of the corporation then intervened on behalf of the corporation and told the bank officials that if they would refrain from any legal action against the company for a year, she would personally see that the debt was paid. The bank orally agreed to the shareholder's arrangement. However, it was never reduced to writing. The bank's promise to the shareholder to refrain from foreclosing on the mortgage would constitute Choices: I. a void promise at the time of inception. or II. a voidable promise as violative of the statute of frauds. or III. an unenforceable promise, because the corporation had a pre-existing duty to pay the debt at maturity.  or IV. an enforceable promise, binding the shareholder as a surety.

There were no warning signs keeping pedestrians out or warning of unloading trucks. A pedestrian walked through the general vicinity but he avoided the unloading area. One of the workers pulled the wrong lever and a load of commercial refrigerators crashed into the street, causing a rumbling tremor in the road. The tremor caused a heavy box to fall off of a parked truck that was about 30 yards away from the loading dock. It fell on the pedestrian, causing serious injury. The pedestrian sued the appliance store for negligence, and the store defended on the basis that it could not foresee such an accident and that the tremor and the box that fell were superseding acts. Will the pedestrian likely survive the store's motion to dismiss pedestrian's lawsuit for damages. Choices: I. No, the plaintiff clearly assumed the risk by entering a dangerous loading/unloading area. or II.

Following their arrest, they were both taken to the police station and given Miranda warnings. They both expressed a desire to remain silent until they could consult an attorney. At the station house, they were booked and placed in separate jail cells. Later that day, and before any attorney consultations could take place, a police detective went to the coconspirator's cell and began interrogating him. The detective told the co-conspirator that if he cooperated in their investigation, the prosecuting attorney would drop charges against him. The co-conspirator then reluctantly confessed and implicated the defendant in the commission of the crimes. The co-conspirator also told the police where the defendant had hidden the stolen property. Based on this information, the police retrieved the stolen property, which included a diamond necklace.

A university that had purchased the company's stock through the same offering sued the company in federal court in State B, claiming that the offering materials violated federal securities laws and seeking $1 million in damages. The individual investor's suit proceeded to trial. The state court ruled that the company's offering materials contained false information and awarded the investor a $25,000 judgment. The university immediately moved for partial summary judgment in its federal action against the company, arguing that the state court judgment bound the federal court on the issue of whether the company's offering materials contained false information. Neither State A nor State B permits nonmutual issue preclusion. Should the court grant the university's motion?  Choices: I. No, because State A does not permit nonmutual issue preclusion. or II.

The rental agreement provided that the land was to be used as farmland. Shortly after the tenant took possession of the tract of land, he built thereon, at his own expense, a barn made of lumber, which was 15 feet wide, 20 feet long, and set on loose bricks. The barn increased the appraised market value of the tract of land from $250,000 to $275,000. The tenant then began farming operations on the land. Toward the end of the lease period, the owner informed the tenant that he was going to put the tract of land up for sale. The next month, when the lease expired, the parties settled a dispute over the tenant's right, if any, to compensation for the improvements by the following written agreement:\"On the sale of the tract of land, the owner hereby agrees to pay the tenant two-thirds of any sale proceeds in excess of $250,000, provided that tenant may remain on the farm for the next year, rent-free, while the owner tries to sell it. After that time, the tenant may remain on the land until closing of the sale, at a monthly rental of $1,000. \"The owner initially set the asking price at $300,000. After receiving scant interest, the owner decided to reduce the price to $260,000. This price reduction so infuriated the tenant that he thereafter made negative comments about the farm to all of the prospective buyers. Finally, 14 months after the agreement between the owner and the tenant was executed, and after rejecting offers for $240,000 and $250,000, the owner sold the tract of land for $256,000 to a buyer who visited the land while the tenant was away on vacation. Thereupon, the tenant, who had failed to pay the last two months rent as per the agreement, moved out. After closing, the owner refused to pay the tenant any of the sale proceeds, and the tenant brought suit to recover damages for breach of contract. Which of the following is the owner's most persuasive argument in defense of the tenant's suit? Choices: I. The tenant committed an uncured material breach of an implied promise to cooperate in the owner's efforts to sell the property, or at least not to hinder the proposed sale. or II. The tenant's negative comments about the farm to prospective buyers amounted to an anticipatory repudiation of the agreement between the owner and the tenant. or III. The tenant's failure to pay any rent for the last two months was a material breach of contract that discharged the owner's remaining duties of performance. or IV. The agreement between the owner and the tenant was voidable because it was a restraint on alienation, since it conditioned a promise to pay for a conveyance of land upon an otherwise invalid leasehold contract.

The statute authorized pari-mutuel betting at certain track locations within the state. A seven-member commission was established and empowered to supervise and regulate the sport's activities. Under an inseparable provision of the statute, the commission was authorized to suspend the racing license of any trainer whose horse tested positive for illegal drugs. The statute permitted the commission to make the suspension without any prior hearing. However, suspended trainers were entitled to a prompt post- suspension hearing and decision on any issues in dispute. The racing season was inaugurated at the largest racetrack in the state. The featured race was a $1,000,000 harness race for 2-year-old trotters. After the awards presentation, the winning horse underwent a standard drug test and traces of cocaine were found in his urine sample. Immediately thereafter, the horse was disqualified and the commission suspended the horse's trainer, without a prior hearing. Without seeking a post-suspension hearing as provided by statute, the trainer brings suit in federal district court challenging the constitutionality of the state harness racing law. The statute is probably Choices: I. constitutional, because being granted a racing license is a privilege, not a right.  or II. constitutional, because the state's interest in suspending the license of horse trainers suspected of illegal drugging is sufficiently important to permit the suspension of any prior hearing.  or III. unconstitutional, because the suspension provision unreasonably interferes with a trainer's right to contract with horse owners and seek gainful employment.  or IV. unconstitutional, because the suspension provision violates due process by not affording a prior hearing.

A nonresident, in order to hunt elk, was required to purchase a combination license at a cost of $225. 00; this entitled him to take one elk, one deer, and one black bear. A nonresident, however, could obtain a license restricted to deer for $51. 00. A resident was not required to buy any combination of licenses but if he did, the cost to him of all the privileges granted by the nonresident combination license was $30. 00. Due to its successful management program for elk, the state has not been compelled to limit the overall number of hunters by means of drawings or lotteries, as have other states. Elk are not hunted commercially in the state. Nonresident hunters seek the animal for its trophy value; the trophy is the distinctive set of antlers.  \u0080\u0098.

The homeowner received notice that her uncle had passed away and left her a two-story mansion in a neighboring city. The homeowner decided to move her primary residence to the mansion and rent the ranch-style home. She entered into a one- year written lease agreement with a tenant. The agreement set the monthly rent at $1,000. Shortly after the tenant took possession of the home, he built, at his own expense, a room addition onto the home. The room addition increased the appraised market value of the home from $200,000 to $250,000. At the expiration of the lease, the homeowner informed the tenant that she had decided to sell the home. She offered the tenant the first opportunity to buy the home, but the tenant replied that he could not afford to do so. The tenant did claim that he should be entitled to compensation for the room addition, since it had increased the value of the home, and the homeowner agreed. The tenant and the homeowner then executed the following agreement:\"On the sale of the ranch-style home, the homeowner hereby promises to pay the tenant one- half of any sale proceeds in excess of $200,000, in compensation of the tenant's efforts in constructing the room addition onto the home. In addition, it is hereby agreed that the tenant may remain on the land until the sale is finalized, at a monthly rent of$500. ,'The homeowner initially set the asking price at $250,000, but received no offers to purchase the home. The homeowner decided to reduce the price to $210,000. This price reduction so infuriated the tenant that he thereafter made negative comments about the home to all of the prospective buyers who visited the home. Two months later, the homeowner sold the home to a buyer for $206,000. The buyer had visited the home while the tenant was away on a business trip and therefore did not hear the tenant's negative comments. Thereupon, the tenant, who had paid no rent for the final two months, moved out. After the sale was finalized, the homeowner refused to pay the tenant any of the sale proceeds. Which of the following statements, if true, most persuasively supports the tenant's contention that he is entitled to recover at least $4,000 from the owner (or the equivalent of one-half of the sale proceeds in excess of $200,000, minus two months' unpaid rent at $500 per month)? Choices: I. The owner breached an implied promise by failing to attempt to sell the property at $250,000, which was the appraised market value of the home.  or II.

Due to the precipitous drop in oil prices, many oil companies have been forced to cut back on oil production and lay off many workers. As a result, unemployment has reached all-time high levels in several states. In order to alleviate this potentially catastrophic situation, the one of those state's legislatures recently enacted a statute requiring that 10% of all oil produced within the state be purchased by the state and reserved for use by state residents.

The stadium, which was built in 1932, had been the home stadium for the local professional baseball team for 30 years. However, in 1962, the baseball team franchise moved to another city. Since 1962, the stadium was left unattended and had deteriorated to such an extent that the walls were in danger of collapsing. Last month, an earthquake struck the city. The earthquake, which registered 6. 9 on the Richter scale, caused considerable damage in the city and caused the stadium to collapse. As the stadium crumbled to the ground, a large section of the press box fell on top of a car that was parked nearby. The auto was crushed, causing its gas tank to rupture. As a result, a large quantity of gasoline spilled along the street and flowed downhill. The gasoline collected in front of a homeowner's home, which was located about a mile from the stadium. Two hours after the earthquake struck, a pedestrian was walking in front of the homeowner's home, smoking a cigarette. When he discarded his lighted cigarette butt in the street, the gasoline exploded. The explosion blew the windows out of the homeowner's home.

On behalf of his company, he borrowed $500,000 from a credit union for this purpose. The company was to repay the loan at the rate of $2,500 per month. The loan was secured by a mortgage on the building that housed the company's operation center. Eight months later, the company's sales started to drop and the company began experiencing cash flow problems. As a result, the company failed to make its loan payments for three consecutive months, causing the credit union to threaten to foreclose on the mortgage. The president's father, a retired wealthy investor, then intervened on behalf of the company, paid the three missed loan payments, and told the credit union that if they would refrain from any legal action against the company for a year, he would personally see that the debt was paid. The credit union orally agreed to the father's surety arrangement. However, it was never reduced to writing. Six months later, the company once again missed consecutive payments, and the credit union filed a foreclosure suit against the company. The father did not learn of the suit until a week later, but he raised no objection, since he thought the credit union was violating its agreement with him by foreclosing within the one-year period, thus relieving him of his part of the bargain. Two weeks later, the credit union's loan officer called the father and said that the credit union would hold off on the foreclosure suit as per their agreement, since the company had just made a new technological development that would place it in a very lucrative and competitive position.

A nonresident, in order to hunt elk, was required to purchase a combination license at a cost of $225. 00; this entitled him to take one elk, one deer, and one black bear. A nonresident, however, could obtain a license restricted to deer for $51. 00. A resident was not required to buy any combination of licenses but if he did, the cost to him of all the privileges granted by the nonresident combination license was $30. 00. Due to its successful management program for elk, the state has not been compelled to limit the overall number of hunters by means of drawings or lotteries, as have other states. Elk are not hunted commercially in the state. Nonresident hunters seek the animal for its trophy value; the trophy is the distinctive set of antlers.  \u0080\u0098. Vhereas the interest of resident hunters more often may be in the meat, among nonresident hunters, big-game hunting is clearly a sport in the state. Two residents of another state bring suit against the state. They assert in their complaint that the disparities between residents and nonresidents in the state hunting license system is unconstitutional. The state's hunting license system should be found Choices: I. constitutional, because it is within the police power of a state to regulate a recreational, noncommercial activity.  or II. constitutional, because there is a compelling state interest.  or III. unconstitutional, because it violates the privileges and immunities clause of Article IV, Section 2.  or IV. unconstitutional, because it violates the equal protection clause of the Fourteenth Amendment.

The man was convicted of selling large quantities of an illegal drug from his house. Acting under a state law authorizing the destruction of buildings that are used for illegal activity, the city destroyed the man\u00d5s house. The man\u00d5s family then rented an apartment and demanded that the city pay the rent for that temporary residence. The family relied on a state law providing that any person who was dispossessed of his or her place of residence because of the actions of city officials was entitled to replacement housing at the city\u00d5s expense until permanent substitute housing could be found. When the city refused to pay the rent for the apartment, the man\u00d5s family sued the city in a state trial court claiming a right to such payment under both the state law and the due process clause of the Fourteenth Amendment to the United States Constitution. The highest state court ruled for the family. Although the court decided that the family had no right to payment under the state law, it held that the Fourteenth Amendment entitled the family to payment of the rent for the temporary apart-ment. In its opinion, the highest state court indicated that in several of its decisions it had found cities liable for compen-sation in similar situations on the basis of the due process clause of the state constitution.

The city then filed a petition for a writ of certiorari in the United States Supreme Court. Does the Court have jurisdiction to review the merits of this case? Choices: I.

Under state law, such an abuse of the prescription-writing privilege requires revocation of a doctor's license. After it received an official notification of the doctor's conviction, the state medical board revoked the doctor's license without affording the doctor any opportunity for a hearing. The doctor has sued the board in state court to set aside the revocation, alleging deprivation of property without due process of law because the board did not provide an opportunity for a trial-type hearing before revoking the license.

The stadium, which was built in 1932, had been the home stadium for the local professional baseball team for 30 years. However, in 1962, the baseball team franchise moved to another city. Since 1962, the stadium was left unattended and had deteriorated to such an extent that the walls were in danger of collapsing. Last month, an earthquake struck the city. The earthquake, which registered 6. 9 on the Richter scale, caused considerable damage in the city and caused the stadium to collapse. As the stadium crumbled to the ground, a large section of the press box fell on top of a car that was parked nearby. The auto was crushed, causing its gas tank to rupture. As a result, a large quantity of gasoline spilled along the street and flowed downhill. The gasoline collected in front of a homeowner's home, which was located about a mile from the stadium. Two hours after the earthquake struck, a pedestrian was walking in front of the homeowner's home, smoking a cigarette. When he discarded his lighted cigarette butt in the street, the gasoline exploded. The explosion blew the windows out of the homeowner's home.

They had been employed by the casino for four years. One day, they were unexpectedly fired by the casino's new manager. Apparently, the casino hired the new manager to get rid of some of the old-time employees and replace them with new personnel at a lower wage. Angered by their firing, the codefendants vowed to get back at the casino. As their revenge, they decided to plant a bomb in the casino and demand $1,000,000. After receiving the money, they would then reveal the location of the bomb and provide details for defusing it. The co-defendants agreed that the casino should be given adequate warning so that nobody would be injured. In accordance with their plan, one of the co-defendants, who was an electronics expert, built the bomb himself. He alone then drove to the casino where he placed the bomb in a hallway closet. Shortly thereafter, the other co-defendant phoned the casino and made a demand for the money. He said a bomb was in the casino and that it would explode in 24 hours unless the money was paid. The casino treated their demand as a crank call and refused to make any payment. With their plans having gone awry, the codefendants agreed that one of them should return to the casino and defuse the bomb. As one of the co-defendants was driving back to the casino, the bomb exploded, killing 30 people. A subsequent investigation revealed that a faulty wire caused the bomb to detonate prematurely. A state statute provides that detonating or attempting to detonate a bomb or explosive device in or near a building or dwelling is a felony. If the co-defendants are charged with violating the aforementioned statute, which of the following statements is correct? Choices: I. Both are guilty, because each participated in the planning of the crime. or II. The co-defendant who built the bomb is guilty, because he built and transported the bomb, but the other co-defendant is not guilty, because his phone call was not a substantial step in the furtherance of the crime. or III. Neither is guilty, because the casino's gross negligence in failing to heed the telephone warning constituted an independent intervening cause of the explosion. or IV. Neither is guilty, because they did not intend for anyone to be killed, but the bomb exploded prematurely. Answer:\n", "Result": "I.

The statute authorized pari-mutuel betting at certain track locations within the state. A seven-member commission was established and empowered to supervise and regulate the sport's activities. Under an inseparable provision of the statute, the commission was authorized to suspend the racing license of any trainer whose horse tested positive for illegal drugs. The statute permitted the commission to make the suspension without any prior hearing. However, suspended trainers were entitled to a prompt post- suspension hearing and decision on any issues in dispute. The racing season was inaugurated at the largest racetrack in the state. The featured race was a $1,000,000 harness race for 2-year-old trotters. After the awards presentation, the winning horse underwent a standard drug test and traces of cocaine were found in his urine sample. Immediately thereafter, the horse was disqualified and the commission suspended the horse's trainer, without a prior hearing. Without seeking a post-suspension hearing as provided by statute, the trainer brings suit in federal district court challenging the constitutionality of the state harness racing law. The statute is probably Choices: I. constitutional, because being granted a racing license is a privilege, not a right.  or II. constitutional, because the state's interest in suspending the license of horse trainers suspected of illegal drugging is sufficiently important to permit the suspension of any prior hearing.  or III. unconstitutional, because the suspension provision unreasonably interferes with a trainer's right to contract with horse owners and seek gainful employment.  or IV. unconstitutional, because the suspension provision violates due process by not affording a prior hearing.

The man was then taken to the police station and asked to submit to a blood test. He refused, stating that he did not want to submit to a blood test because he was afraid of needles.

The statute authorized pari-mutuel betting at certain track locations within the state. A seven-member commission was established and empowered to supervise and regulate the sport's activities. Under an inseparable provision of the statute, the commission was authorized to suspend the racing license of any trainer whose horse tested positive for illegal drugs. The statute permitted the commission to make the suspension without any prior hearing. However, suspended trainers were entitled to a prompt post- suspension hearing and decision on any issues in dispute. The racing season was inaugurated at the largest racetrack in the state. The featured race was a $1,000,000 harness race for 2-year-old trotters. After the awards presentation, the winning horse underwent a standard drug test and traces of cocaine were found in his urine sample. Immediately thereafter, the horse was disqualified and the commission suspended the horse's trainer, without a prior hearing. Without seeking a post-suspension hearing as provided by statute, the trainer brings suit in federal district court challenging the constitutionality of the state harness racing law. The statute is probably Choices: I. constitutional, because being granted a racing license is a privilege, not a right.  or II. constitutional, because the state's interest in suspending the license of horse trainers suspected of illegal drugging is sufficiently important to permit the suspension of any prior hearing.  or III. unconstitutional, because the suspension provision unreasonably interferes with a trainer's right to contract with horse owners and seek gainful employment.  or IV. unconstitutional, because the suspension provision violates due process by not affording a prior hearing.

Several years later, at a time when the woman still owed the bank $750,000 on the mortgage loan, she sold the farm to a man for $900,000. The man paid the woman $150,000 in cash and specifically assumed the mortgage note. The bank received notice of this transaction and elected not to exer-cise the optional due-on-sale clause in the mortgage. Without informing the man, the bank later released the woman from any further personal liability on the note. After he had owned the farm for a number of years, the man defaulted on the loan. The bank properly accelerated the loan, and the farm was eventually sold at a foreclosure sale for $500,000. Because there was still $600,000 owing on the note, the bank sued the man for the $100,000 deficiency. Is the man liable to the bank for the deficiency? Choices: I. No, because the woman would have still been primarily liable for payment, but the bank had released her from personal liability. or II. No, because the bank\u00d5s release of the woman from per-sonal liability also released the man. or III. Yes, because the bank\u00d5s release of the woman consti-tuted a clogging of the equity of redemption. or IV. Yes, because the man\u00d5s personal liability on the note was not affected by the bank\u00d5s release of the woman. Answer:\nIV.

The plant had been shut down for 10 years. Much to Darlene's chagrin, officials at the plant had announced plans to reopen the plant. Darlene, who was a waitress at a local restaurant, devised a scheme whereby she would contaminate oysters at her restaurant with small amounts of a poisonous substance. Although she didn't want to seriously injure anyone, Darlene believed that if some people got sick from eating the oysters, they would attribute their illness to nuclear waste from the power plant. To facilitate her plan, she stole some poison from a local pharmacy. She sprinkled it on some oysters at the restaurant where she worked. Mistakenly, she put too much of the poison on some of the oysters. A few of the customers who ate the oysters became sick and nauseated. One person suffered convulsions and died from the poisoning. A statute in the jurisdiction provides: \"Any intentional and premeditated killing, or one occurring during the perpetration of a felony, is murder in the first degree. Murder in the second degree is murder with intent to cause serious bodily harm. Manslaughter is an unlawful killing due to recklessness. \"Assault with intent to kill or to cause serious physical injury is a felony in the jurisdiction. There are no separate felonies relating to adulterating food or poisoning. The most serious crime for which Darlene can properly be convicted is Choices: I. first-degree murder, because her acts were intentional and premeditated.  or II. first-degree murder, because the death occurred during the commission of a felony.  or III. second-degree murder, because of the intent to cause physical harm.  or IV. manslaughter, because her conduct was reckless.

The man was convicted of selling large quantities of an illegal drug from his house. Acting under a state law authorizing the destruction of buildings that are used for illegal activity, the city destroyed the man\u00d5s house. The man\u00d5s family then rented an apartment and demanded that the city pay the rent for that temporary residence. The family relied on a state law providing that any person who was dispossessed of his or her place of residence because of the actions of city officials was entitled to replacement housing at the city\u00d5s expense until permanent substitute housing could be found. When the city refused to pay the rent for the apartment, the man\u00d5s family sued the city in a state trial court claiming a right to such payment under both the state law and the due process clause of the Fourteenth Amendment to the United States Constitution. The highest state court ruled for the family. Although the court decided that the family had no right to payment under the state law, it held that the Fourteenth Amendment entitled the family to payment of the rent for the temporary apart-ment. In its opinion, the highest state court indicated that in several of its decisions it had found cities liable for compen-sation in similar situations on the basis of the due process clause of the state constitution. But the highest state court declined to base its holding on the state constitution because that issue had not been properly raised in the case. The city then filed a petition for a writ of certiorari in the United States Supreme Court. Does the Court have jurisdiction to review the merits of this case? Choices: I. Yes, because the highest state court based its decision wholly on federal law grounds. or II. Yes, because the federal and state law issues in this case are so intertwined that a resolution of the federal law issues is necessary to facilitate a proper determination of the state law issues. or III. No, because the decision of the highest state court ren-ders the case moot. or IV. No, because independent state law grounds could have been used to justify the result in this case. Answer:\nI. Yes, because the highest state court based its decision wholly on federal law grounds.\n\nQuestion: [question] Choices: [choices] Answer: [answer]\nQuestion: A woman belonged to an organization that advocated for the United States to preemptively attack certain foreign countries.

The man's blood alcohol level was measured at 0.15 percent. The man's defense was that he had consumed no alcoholic beverages before driving. The man claimed that he had eaten a large quantity of bread before driving, which had caused his blood alcohol level to rise. The man's defense was based on the \"Rise and Fall\" theory, which holds that the consumption of large quantities of bread or other foods containing yeast can cause a person's blood alcohol level to rise. The prosecution presented expert testimony that the \"Rise and Fall\" theory was not scientifically valid. The trial judge instructed the jury that it could consider the \"Rise and Fall\" theory as a possible explanation for the man's blood alcohol level, but that it was not required to accept that theory as true. The jury found the man guilty of driving under the influence of alcohol. The man appealed, claiming that the trial judge had erred in allowing the jury to consider the \"Rise and Fall\" theory as a defense.

The state government approved the request and certified the need for more nursing homes in that township. The township, however, vehemently opposed permitting a nursing home in a residential zoning district and refused the building permit. The township's zoning law has 15 residential zones, each of which does not allow a nursing home.

The production fee clause also stipulated that the $100,000 would be paid to the production company \"on condition that the filming and editing be directed under the personal supervision of the president of the production company. \" The contract made no other reference to compensation. Thereafter, the production company filmed and edited the ten campaign commercials, which the candidate approved.

According to the bifurcated trial system, whenever a defendant pleads not guilty to an offense by reason of insanity, two trials will be held. The first one will simply determine whether the defendant has committed the offense for which she is charged. This trial will not address the issue of insanity. In the event that it is found that the defendant has, in fact, committed the offense, then a second trial will be conducted to determine whether she should be exculpated for the criminal action by reason of insanity. A woman was arrested and charged with murder. She pleaded not guilty by reason of insanity. At her first trial, the state introduced evidence showing that the woman was having an affair with the victim. When the victim tried to break off their relationship, the woman shot and killed him during a lover's quarrel. The woman was then called to testify in her own behalf. She testified that she had been living with the victim for two years prior to the time of his death. During that period she had undergone psychiatric treatment and was diagnosed as being schizophrenic. She further testified that at the time the victim was killed, she was under the influence of narcotics. While she was hallucinating, she remembered perceiving the victim as a demon and shot at this satanic figure in order to free herself from his evil spell.

The homeowner received notice that her uncle had passed away and left her a two-story mansion in a neighboring city. The homeowner decided to move her primary residence to the mansion and rent the ranch-style home. She entered into a one- year written lease agreement with a tenant. The agreement set the monthly rent at $1,000. Shortly after the tenant took possession of the home, he built, at his own expense, a room addition onto the home. The room addition increased the appraised market value of the home from $200,000 to $250,000. At the expiration of the lease, the homeowner informed the tenant that she had decided to sell the home. She offered the tenant the first opportunity to buy the home, but the tenant replied that he could not afford to do so. The tenant did claim that he should be entitled to compensation for the room addition, since it had increased the value of the home, and the homeowner agreed. The tenant and the homeowner then executed the following agreement:\"On the sale of the ranch-style home, the homeowner hereby promises to pay the tenant one- half of any sale proceeds in excess of $200,000, in compensation of the tenant's efforts in constructing the room addition onto the home. In addition, it is hereby agreed that the tenant may remain on the land until the sale is finalized, at a monthly rent of$500. ,'The homeowner initially set the asking price at $250,000, but received no offers to purchase the home. The homeowner decided to reduce the price to $210,000. This price reduction so infuriated the tenant that he thereafter made negative comments about the home to all of the prospective buyers who visited the home. Two months later, the homeowner sold the home to a buyer for $206,000. The buyer had visited the home while the tenant was away on a business trip and therefore did not hear the tenant's negative comments. Thereupon, the tenant, who had paid no rent for the final two months, moved out. After the sale was finalized, the homeowner refused to pay the tenant any of the sale proceeds. Which of the following statements, if true, most persuasively supports the tenant's contention that he is entitled to recover at least $4,000 from the owner (or the equivalent of one-half of the sale proceeds in excess of $200,000, minus two months' unpaid rent at $500 per month)? Choices: I. The owner breached an implied promise by failing to attempt to sell the property at $250,000, which was the appraised market value of the home.  or II. Since the tenant made no negative comments about the home to the buyer, there is no showing that the tenant's remarks to the other prospective buyers necessarily caused any loss to the owner (i. e. , prevented her from selling the home for more than $210,000).  or III. The agreement between the homeowner that the tenant contained only one express condition (i. e. , the tenant was permitted to remain in the home during the owner's efforts to sell it), and since that condition has occurred, the tenant is entitled to his share of the proceeds from the sale.  or IV. Even if the tenant's failure to pay any rent for the last two months was a material breach of contract, the owner's promise to pay the tenant a share of the proceeds of the sale was an independent covenant.  Answer:\nII.

Due to the precipitous drop in oil prices, many oil companies have been forced to cut back on oil production and lay off many workers. As a result, unemployment has reached all-time high levels in several states. In order to alleviate this potentially catastrophic situation, the one of those state's legislatures recently enacted a statute requiring that 10% of all oil produced within the state be purchased by the state and reserved for use by state residents. The purpose of the statute was twofold: (1) it was intended to stimulate the oil industry within the state by encouraging more production and exploration, and (2) it was designed to create an oil reserve so that state residents and industries would not suffer unduly from future oil shortages. Subsequently, Congress enacted a statute forbidding states to reserve local resources for local use in this manner. Is this state statute constitutional? Choices: I. Yes, because Congress has not expressly forbidden states to reserve local resources for local use.  or II.

Some years prior to her death, she conveyed a deed in fee simple to her oldest son. After her death, her youngest son filed a claim against the estate contending that the father's will devised only a life estate to his wife. A state statute said that a fee simple would be presumed where the intent of the testator did not clearly show an intent to devise a lesser estate. The lower court held that the widow had received a defeasible fee conditioned on her remaining a widow.

Will the appellate court likely reverse the lower court's decision and rule that the oldest son did not receive full title to the property? Choices: I. Yes, because it was a life estate that ends on her remarriage or death, with a remainder over to all of the sons. or II. Yes, the deed could not convey more than a life estate because of the condition in the will. or III.

Some years prior to her death, she conveyed a deed in fee simple to her oldest son. After her death, her youngest son filed a claim against the estate contending that the father's will devised only a life estate to his wife. A state statute said that a fee simple would be presumed where the intent of the testator did not clearly show an intent to devise a lesser estate. The lower court held that the widow had received a defeasible fee conditioned on her remaining a widow. Because she did not marry, the deed to the son ripened into an indefeasible fee absolute at the time of conveyance. The younger son appealed. Will the appellate court likely reverse the lower court's decision and rule that the oldest son did not receive full title to the property? Choices: I. Yes, because it was a life estate that ends on her remarriage or death, with a remainder over to all of the sons. or II. Yes, the deed could not convey more than a life estate because of the condition in the will. or III. No, because the will devises a fee simple that was defeasible if she had remarried; the title and the deed ripened into an indefeasible fee simple when she conveyed the property. or IV. No, the deed superseded anything that was stated in the will because she was still alive when she conveyed title to her oldest son. Answer:\nIII.

The individual investor's suit proceeded to trial. The state court ruled that the company's offering materials contained false information and awarded the investor a $25,000 judgment. The university immediately moved for partial summary judgment in its federal action against the company, arguing that the state court judgment bound the federal court on the issue of whether the company's offering materials contained false information. Neither State A nor State B permits nonmutual issue preclusion. Should the court grant the university's motion?  Choices: I. No, because State A does not permit nonmutual issue preclusion. or II. No, because the federal court sits in a state that does not permit nonmutual issue preclusion. or III. Yes, because federal law permits nonmutual issue preclusion. or IV.

After the property was sold at sheriff's sale for $50,000, the bank sent the consumer due notice of a deficiency still owing of $10,000. The original note, however, had limited bank's recourse to $50,000 or higher. There was no response and the bank entered a deficiency judgment for $10,000. When it started execution proceedings to collect the $10,000, the defendants entered a defense, arguing that the bank was limited to recourse of $50,000 or higher. The judgment for $10,000 was therefore void and unenforceable. Will the court allow enforcement of the deficiency judgment for $10,000? Choices: I.

The plant had been shut down for 10 years. Much to Darlene's chagrin, officials at the plant had announced plans to reopen the plant. Darlene, who was a waitress at a local restaurant, devised a scheme whereby she would contaminate oysters at her restaurant with small amounts of a poisonous substance. Although she didn't want to seriously injure anyone, Darlene believed that if some people got sick from eating the oysters, they would attribute their illness to nuclear waste from the power plant. To facilitate her plan, she stole some poison from a local pharmacy. She sprinkled it on some oysters at the restaurant where she worked. Mistakenly, she put too much of the poison on some of the oysters. A few of the customers who ate the oysters became sick and nauseated. One person suffered convulsions and died from the poisoning. A statute in the jurisdiction provides: \"Any intentional and premeditated killing, or one occurring during the perpetration of a felony, is murder in the first degree. Murder in the second degree is murder with intent to cause serious bodily harm.

Goods of all kinds were in piles or strewn about the sidewalk. During the riot, a defendant was walking along the street when he paused in front of an appliance store. He picked up a portable television set that was lying on the sidewalk and started to walk off quickly. A police officer who was standing in front of the shop rushed after the defendant and arrested him. The defendant, an indigent, was charged with grand larceny, a felony carrying the maximum penalty of seven months imprisonment and a S 1,000 fine. At his arraignment, the judge advised the defendant of his right to have counsel appointed for him. The defendant, however, told the judge that he wanted to represent himself and waive his right to a jury trial. The judge then questioned the defendant at length about his demands. The defendant indicated that he had no previous legal experience. He told the judge that the reason he didn't want a court-appointed attorney to represent him was because he didn't trust lawyers. The judge did not find the defendant's reasons for representing himself to be persuasive and appointed an attorney to represent him. Thereafter, an attorney was appointed by the court to represent the defendant. The attorney told the court that the defendant wanted a non-jury trial. However, at the prosecution's request, the court impaneled a jury. The defendant was subsequently convicted by the jury and sentenced to six months imprisonment. In addition, the defendant was ordered to reimburse the state $450 to cover the cost of his attorney.

Some years prior to her death, she conveyed a deed in fee simple to her oldest son. After her death, her youngest son filed a claim against the estate contending that the father's will devised only a life estate to his wife. A state statute said that a fee simple would be presumed where the intent of the testator did not clearly show an intent to devise a lesser estate. The lower court held that the widow had received a defeasible fee conditioned on her remaining a widow. Because she did not marry, the deed to the son ripened into an indefeasible fee absolute at the time of conveyance. The younger son appealed. Will the appellate court likely reverse the lower court's decision and rule that the oldest son did not receive full title to the property? Choices: I. Yes, because it was a life estate that ends on her remarriage or death, with a remainder over to all of the sons. or II. Yes, the deed could not convey more than a life estate because of the condition in the will. or III. No, because the will devises a fee simple that was defeasible if she had remarried; the title and the deed ripened into an indefeasible fee simple when she conveyed the property. or IV. No, the deed superseded anything that was stated in the will because she was still alive when she conveyed title to her oldest son. Answer:\nIII.

In accordance with the new law, all beer consumed within the state must be sold in aluminum cans that are recyclable. There is a provision of the statute that does permit breweries to distribute beer to bars, taverns, and restaurants in kegs for \"on-site\" consumption by patrons.

Of that total, 75% of the beer was bottled outside the state, while 25% was bottled by companies in-state. The legislature passed the law at the strong urging of the aluminum can industry. It was estimated that one aluminum company alone spent over $5,000,000 in its lobbying campaign for the passage of the bill.

The man\u00d5s family then rented an apartment and demanded that the city pay the rent for that temporary residence. The family relied on a state law providing that any person who was dispossessed of his or her place of residence because of the actions of city officials was entitled to replacement housing at the city\u00d5s expense until permanent substitute housing could be found. When the city refused to pay the rent for the apartment, the man\u00d5s family sued the city in a state trial court claiming a right to such payment under both the state law and the due process clause of the Fourteenth Amendment to the United States Constitution. The highest state court ruled for the family. Although the court decided that the family had no right to payment under the state law, it held that the Fourteenth Amendment entitled the family to payment of the rent for the temporary apart-ment. In its opinion, the highest state court indicated that in several of its decisions it had found cities liable for compen-sation in similar situations on the basis of the due process clause of the state constitution.

The homeowner received notice that her uncle had passed away and left her a two-story mansion in a neighboring city. The homeowner decided to move her primary residence to the mansion and rent the ranch-style home. She entered into a one- year written lease agreement with a tenant. The agreement set the monthly rent at $1,000. Shortly after the tenant took possession of the home, he built, at his own expense, a room addition onto the home. The room addition increased the appraised market value of the home from $200,000 to $250,000. At the expiration of the lease, the homeowner informed the tenant that she had decided to sell the home. She offered the tenant the first opportunity to buy the home, but the tenant replied that he could not afford to do so. The tenant did claim that he should be entitled to compensation for the room addition, since it had increased the value of the home, and the homeowner agreed. The tenant and the homeowner then executed the following agreement:\"On the sale of the ranch-style home, the homeowner hereby promises to pay the tenant one- half of any sale proceeds in excess of $200,000, in compensation of the tenant's efforts in constructing the room addition onto the home. In addition, it is hereby agreed that the tenant may remain on the land until the sale is finalized, at a monthly rent of$500. ,'The homeowner initially set the asking price at $250,000, but received no offers to purchase the home. The homeowner decided to reduce the price to $210,000. This price reduction so infuriated the tenant that he thereafter made negative comments about the home to all of the prospective buyers who visited the home. Two months later, the homeowner sold the home to a buyer for $206,000. The buyer had visited the home while the tenant was away on a business trip and therefore did not hear the tenant's negative comments. Thereupon, the tenant, who had paid no rent for the final two months, moved out. After the sale was finalized, the homeowner refused to pay the tenant any of the sale proceeds. Which of the following statements, if true, most persuasively supports the tenant's contention that he is entitled to recover at least $4,000 from the owner (or the equivalent of one-half of the sale proceeds in excess of $200,000, minus two months' unpaid rent at $500 per month)? Choices: I. The owner breached an implied promise by failing to attempt to sell the property at $250,000, which was the appraised market value of the home.  or II. Since the tenant made no negative comments about the home to the buyer, there is no showing that the tenant's remarks to the other prospective buyers necessarily caused any loss to the owner (i. e. , prevented her from selling the home for more than $210,000).  or III. The agreement between the homeowner that the tenant contained only one express condition (i. e. , the tenant was permitted to remain in the home during the owner's efforts to sell it), and since that condition has occurred, the tenant is entitled to his share of the proceeds from the sale.  or IV. Even if the tenant's failure to pay any rent for the last two months was a material breach of contract, the owner's promise to pay the tenant a share of the proceeds of the sale was an independent covenant.  Answer:\nII. Since the tenant made no negative comments about the home to the buyer, there is no showing that the tenant's remarks to the other prospective buyers necessarily caused any loss to the owner (i. e. , prevented her from selling the home for more than $210,000). \n\nQuestion: [question] Choices: [choices] Answer: [answer]\nQuestion: A father lived with his son, who was addicted to crack cocaine.

Some years prior to her death, she conveyed a deed in fee simple to her oldest son. After her death, her youngest son filed a claim against the estate contending that the father's will devised only a life estate to his wife. A state statute said that a fee simple would be presumed where the intent of the testator did not clearly show an intent to devise a lesser estate. The lower court held that the widow had received a defeasible fee conditioned on her remaining a widow.

Which of the following is the best argument the state can make for the continued validity of its law?  Choices: I.

The state government approved the request and certified the need for more nursing homes in that township. The township, however, vehemently opposed permitting a nursing home in a residential zoning district and refused the building permit. The township's zoning law has 15 residential zones, each of which does not allow a nursing home. The nursing home sued in federal court requesting declaratory and injunctive relief on the basis that the zoning law was discriminatory against handicapped persons and a violation of federal law. Will the court compel the township to allow the construction of the nursing home? Choices: I. Yes, under federal law all municipalities must provide reasonable accommodations to handicapped persons, and the zoning law in question violates that mandate. or II.

In accordance with the new law, all beer consumed within the state must be sold in aluminum cans that are recyclable. There is a provision of the statute that does permit breweries to distribute beer to bars, taverns, and restaurants in kegs for \"on-site\" consumption by patrons. Before the passage of the law, approximately 28% of all beer consumed in the state was packaged in glass bottles. Of that total, 75% of the beer was bottled outside the state, while 25% was bottled by companies in-state. The legislature passed the law at the strong urging of the aluminum can industry.

The statute authorized pari-mutuel betting at certain track locations within the state. A seven-member commission was established and empowered to supervise and regulate the sport's activities. Under an inseparable provision of the statute, the commission was authorized to suspend the racing license of any trainer whose horse tested positive for illegal drugs. The statute permitted the commission to make the suspension without any prior hearing. However, suspended trainers were entitled to a prompt post- suspension hearing and decision on any issues in dispute. The racing season was inaugurated at the largest racetrack in the state. The featured race was a $1,000,000 harness race for 2-year-old trotters. After the awards presentation, the winning horse underwent a standard drug test and traces of cocaine were found in his urine sample. Immediately thereafter, the horse was disqualified and the commission suspended the horse's trainer, without a prior hearing. Without seeking a post-suspension hearing as provided by statute, the trainer brings suit in federal district court challenging the constitutionality of the state harness racing law. The statute is probably Choices: I. constitutional, because being granted a racing license is a privilege, not a right.  or II. constitutional, because the state's interest in suspending the license of horse trainers suspected of illegal drugging is sufficiently important to permit the suspension of any prior hearing.  or III. unconstitutional, because the suspension provision unreasonably interferes with a trainer's right to contract with horse owners and seek gainful employment.  or IV. unconstitutional, because the suspension provision violates due process by not affording a prior hearing.  Answer:\nII. constitutional, because the state's interest in suspending the license of horse trainers suspected of illegal drugging is sufficiently important to permit the suspension of any prior hearing. \n\nQuestion: [question] Choices: [choices] Answer: [answer]\nQuestion: A shop owner domiciled in State A sued a distributor in a federal district court in State A for breach of a contract. The shop owner sought $100,000 in damages for allegedly defective goods that the distributor had provided under the contract. The distributor is incorporated in State B, with its principal place of business in State C. The distributor brought in as a third-party defendant the wholesaler that had provided the goods to the distributor, alleging that the wholesaler had a duty to indemnify the distributor for any damages recovered by the shop owner. The wholesaler is incorporated in State B, with its principal place of business in State A. The wholesaler has asserted a $60,000 counterclaim against the distributor for payment for the goods at issue, and the distributor has moved to dismiss the counterclaim for lack of subject-matter jurisdiction. Should the motion to dismiss be granted? Choices: I. No, because the wholesaler's and the distributor's principal places of business are diverse. or II.

While Ann was away on a business trip, someone broke into her garage and stole her golf clubs. The next week, Ann was planning to go on vacation and asked Bea if she could borrow her golf clubs. Bea agreed and loaned her golf clubs to Ann, who promised to return them after her vacation. When Ann returned home, she kept the golf clubs and continued to use them. A few weeks later, Bea was having dinner with Carla and learned that Carla owed Ann $4,000. Carla had just been laid off from her job and did not have the money to repay Ann. Bea told Carla that she would contact Ann and make arrangements to repay the loan on her behalf. Thereupon, Ann and Bea entered into a written agreement wherein Bea promised to pay Ann, at a rate of $400 a month, the matured $4,000 debt that Carla owed Ann. In the same written instrument, Ann promised to return Bea's golf clubs, which she still had in her possession. Ann, however, made no written or oral. commitment to forbear to sue Carla to collect the $4,000 debt; and Bea made no oral or written request for any such forbearance. After this agreement between Ann and Bea was signed and executed, Ann promptly returned the golf clubs to Bea. For the next six months, Bea made and Ann accepted the $400 monthly payments as agreed. During that period, Ann, in fact, did forbear to take any legal action against Carla. However, Bea then repudiated her agreement with Ann, and 30 days later Ann filed a contract action against Bea. Assume that the applicable statute of limitations on Ann's antecedent claim against Carla expired the day before Ann filed her contract action against Bea. Which of the following is the most persuasive argument that Bea is not liable to Ann under the terms of their written agreement? Choices: I. Since Ann did not expressly promise to forbear to sue Carla to collect the antecedent $4,000 debt, Ann's forbearance for six months could not constitute consideration for Bea's promise. or II. Since the written agreement between Bea and Ann shows a gross imbalance between the values of the promises exchanged, the consideration for Bea's promise was legally insufficient to support it. or III. Since Carla, when the agreement between Ann and Bea was made, had a pre-existing duty to repay the $4,000 debt to Ann, there was no consideration for Bea's promise to Ann. or IV. Since Ann had a pre-existing duty to return Bea's golf clubs to her when the agreement between Ann and Bea was made, there was no consideration for Bea's promise to Ann. Answer:\n", "Result": "I.

He uses a candle to meditate when he is stressed on the job, which then calms him down. He has been mulling an idea in his mind to take a lot of money from his employer using his computer skills, and he has worked out a general plan in his mind. Once he obtains the money, he thinks it might be good to let a candle drop and have the whole building burn down. While he is out at lunch, the janitorial staff came through his office. While cleaning the area, one person lit a candle on the man's desk. When they left, he forgot to blow it out. They slammed the door on the way out, causing the lit candle to fall. It started a fire that burned the building down. What crime, if any, is the man most likely to be convicted of? Choices: I. Attempted arson, because he took steps to have a candle there to finish the criminal act, but someone else ended up causing an accidental fire that he did not cause. or II. Arson, because he took a substantial act by having the candle on his desk, and the crime was finished by the foreseeable act of a janitor lighting it and causing a fire. or III. Attempted arson and attempted murder. Attempted arson because he took a substantial step to committing arson. or IV. No crime, because he only had ideas in his mind and leaving the candle on his desk where he used it for meditation cannot be a substantial act toward committing a crime. Answer:\nIV.

A new federal statute requires all power equipment, including lawn mowers, to be labeled with energy efficiency stickers to permit purchasers to make informed choices when buying such equipment. The statute does not expressly preempt state law. Assume that no other federal statute or administrative regulation addresses the energy efficiency of power equipment. Which of the following is the best argument the state can make for the continued validity of its law?  Choices: I. Congress cannot preempt state laws requiring a specified minimum level of requiring a specified minimum level of fuel efficiency for lawn mowers, because the use of such equipment is a wholly local event and, therefore, is beyond the regulatory authority vested in Congress by the commerce clause. or II. The law is unaffected by the federal statute, because Congress did not expressly prohibit state laws requiring power equipment to meet specified levels of fuel efficiency. or III. The purpose of the law is consistent with the purpose of the federal statute, enforcement of the law would not interfere with the full execution of the statute, and there is no evidence that Congress intended to preclude the states from enacting supplemental laws on this subject. or IV. There is a very strong presumption that a specific state law on a subject normally within the state's police power prevails over a more general federal statute, because the Tenth Amendment reserves to the states primary authority over matters affecting public health, welfare, and safety.

Although it is not the only lake in the county, it is the largest and most scenic, and it attracts visitors from miles around. One of its biggest assets is the excellent fishing and boating, which is available to the public at large. Three years ago, in order to enhance the recreational aspects of the lake, the county leased a sizable portion of the lake and surrounding parkland to a company owned by the most prominent family in the county. The lease required the company to construct and operate a first-rate yacht house and club, complete with bar, restaurant, and private marina, and to pay the county 10% of its net profits as rent. The company set up bylaws, which were reviewed and approved by the county at the time the lease was negotiated. According to the bylaws, the yacht club, complete with its restaurant and bar, would be open to members only, and the membership committee was empowered to set up strict membership \"standards,\" as well as the cost of membership fees and dues. Upon completion of the facilities, the state granted the company a license to sell alcoholic beverages in its restaurant and bar. The membership committee announced that the membership fee was $5,000 and the monthly dues $75. Furthermore, the membership committee had a policy of approving only membership applications from men, while disapproving and denying all applications from women. There were other similar facilities within the county available to women. A woman resident of the county brings suit against the company, claiming that her membership application was denied only because she is a woman, and that its policy of excluding women as a group denies her equal protection rights. Which of the following is the most accurate statement? Choices: I. The plaintiff will lose, because classifications based on sex have not yet been held to violate the equal protection clause. or II. The plaintiff will prevail unless denial of membership to women can be justified by some \"compelling interest,\" since such discrimination is \"suspect\" and requires the strictest equal protection test. or III.

The woman's complaint included a lengthy description of what the supervisor had said and done over the years, quoting his telephone calls and emails to her and her own emails to the supervisor's manager asking for help. The employer moved for summary judgment, alleging that the woman was a pathological liar who had filed the action and included fictitious documents in revenge for having been fired. Because the woman's attorney was at a lengthy out-of-state trial when the summary-judgment motion was filed, he failed to respond to it. The court therefore granted the motion in a one-line order and entered final judgment. The woman has appealed. Is the appellate court likely to uphold the trial court's ruling? Choices: I. No, because the complaint's allegations were detailed and specific. or II. No, because the employer moved for summary judgment on the basis that the woman was not credible, creating a factual dispute. or III. Yes, because the woman's failure to respond to the summary-judgment motion means that there was no sworn affidavit to support her allegations and supporting documents. or IV.

The homeowner received notice that her uncle had passed away and left her a two-story mansion in a neighboring city. The homeowner decided to move her primary residence to the mansion and rent the ranch-style home. She entered into a one- year written lease agreement with a tenant. The agreement set the monthly rent at $1,000. Shortly after the tenant took possession of the home, he built, at his own expense, a room addition onto the home. The room addition increased the appraised market value of the home from $200,000 to $250,000. At the expiration of the lease, the homeowner informed the tenant that she had decided to sell the home. She offered the tenant the first opportunity to buy the home, but the tenant replied that he could not afford to do so. The tenant did claim that he should be entitled to compensation for the room addition, since it had increased the value of the home, and the homeowner agreed. The tenant and the homeowner then executed the following agreement:\"On the sale of the ranch-style home, the homeowner hereby promises to pay the tenant one- half of any sale proceeds in excess of $200,000, in compensation of the tenant's efforts in constructing the room addition onto the home. In addition, it is hereby agreed that the tenant may remain on the land until the sale is finalized, at a monthly rent of$500. ,'The homeowner initially set the asking price at $250,000, but received no offers to purchase the home. The homeowner decided to reduce the price to $210,000. This price reduction so infuriated the tenant that he thereafter made negative comments about the home to all of the prospective buyers who visited the home. Two months later, the homeowner sold the home to a buyer for $206,000. The buyer had visited the home while the tenant was away on a business trip and therefore did not hear the tenant's negative comments. Thereupon, the tenant, who had paid no rent for the final two months, moved out. After the sale was finalized, the homeowner refused to pay the tenant any of the sale proceeds. Which of the following statements, if true, most persuasively supports the tenant's contention that he is entitled to recover at least $4,000 from the owner (or the equivalent of one-half of the sale proceeds in excess of $200,000, minus two months' unpaid rent at $500 per month)?

Since the tenant made no negative comments about the home to the buyer, there is no showing that the tenant's remarks to the other prospective buyers necessarily caused any loss to the owner (i. e. , prevented her from selling the home for more than $210,000).  or III. The agreement between the homeowner that the tenant contained only one express condition (i. e. , the tenant was permitted to remain in the home during the owner's efforts to sell it), and since that condition has occurred, the tenant is entitled to his share of the proceeds from the sale.  or IV. Even if the tenant's failure to pay any rent for the last two months was a material breach of contract, the owner's promise to pay the tenant a share of the proceeds of the sale was an independent covenant.  Answer:\nII.

When the girlfriend got drunk, she would become abusive and beat her boyfriend. During the course of their relationship, the beatings became more violent and more frequent. Unable to endure the physical abuse any longer, the boyfriend hired a hit man to kill his girlfriend. One night while the girlfriend was asleep, the hit man entered the home with a key given to him by the boyfriend and shot the girlfriend to death. Afterward, the boyfriend was prosecuted for murder as an accomplice. The defense sought to have the judge instruct the jury that the boyfriend acted in self-defense. Based on the given facts, should the judge give such an instruction to the jury? Choices: I. No, because the boyfriend's belief in the necessity of deadly force in self-defense was unreasonable.  or II. No, because the boyfriend could have avoided the danger by safely retreating.  or III. Yes, because a reasonable jury could conclude that the boyfriend acted in self-defense by using necessary force to protect himself from the girlfriend's constant violent attacks.  or IV. Yes, because a criminal defendant's Sixth Amendment right to a jury trial prohibits a court from refusing to submit affirmative defenses to the jury.  Answer:\nI.

The letter did not say how the writer personally knew that there were drugs or where they were stored. The investigating detective drew up an affidavit of probable cause based on the statements in the letter and presented the request for a search warrant and the affidavit to a magistrate judge. The magistrate judge signed a search warrant based on the affidavit. The police raided the home and found several pounds of cocaine in the basement. The defendants filed a motion to suppress the evidence based on insufficient cause to issue a warrant. The state courts rejected the suppression motion. What would the U.S. Supreme Court most likely decide? Choices: I. The Court would validate the search warrant because there were sufficient detailed allegations in the letter to justify a probable cause finding. or II. The Court would invalidate the warrant because there was insufficient information and no corroboration to support the credibility and personal knowledge of the informant. or III. The warrant was valid because when the informant's information turns out to be true after the warrant is issued and executed, then that validates the affidavit of probable cause. or IV. The warrant was invalid because affidavits of probable cause must give the name and address of the informant; an affidavit cannot be based on an anonymous informant. Answer:\nII.

Following their arrest, they were both taken to the police station and given Miranda warnings. They both expressed a desire to remain silent until they could consult an attorney. At the station house, they were booked and placed in separate jail cells. Later that day, and before any attorney consultations could take place, a police detective went to the coconspirator's cell and began interrogating him. The detective told the co-conspirator that if he cooperated in their investigation, the prosecuting attorney would drop charges against him.

The statute authorized pari-mutuel betting at certain track locations within the state. A seven-member commission was established and empowered to supervise and regulate the sport's activities. Under an inseparable provision of the statute, the commission was authorized to suspend the racing license of any trainer whose horse tested positive for illegal drugs. The statute permitted the commission to make the suspension without any prior hearing. However, suspended trainers were entitled to a prompt post- suspension hearing and decision on any issues in dispute. The racing season was inaugurated at the largest racetrack in the state. The featured race was a $1,000,000 harness race for 2-year-old trotters. After the awards presentation, the winning horse underwent a standard drug test and traces of cocaine were found in his urine sample. Immediately thereafter, the horse was disqualified and the commission suspended the horse's trainer, without a prior hearing. Without seeking a post-suspension hearing as provided by statute, the trainer brings suit in federal district court challenging the constitutionality of the state harness racing law. The statute is probably Choices: I. constitutional, because being granted a racing license is a privilege, not a right.  or II. constitutional, because the state's interest in suspending the license of horse trainers suspected of illegal drugging is sufficiently important to permit the suspension of any prior hearing.  or III. unconstitutional, because the suspension provision unreasonably interferes with a trainer's right to contract with horse owners and seek gainful employment.  or IV. unconstitutional, because the suspension provision violates due process by not affording a prior hearing.

The man was convicted of selling large quantities of an illegal drug from his house. Acting under a state law authorizing the destruction of buildings that are used for illegal activity, the city destroyed the man\u00d5s house. The man\u00d5s family then rented an apartment and demanded that the city pay the rent for that temporary residence. The family relied on a state law providing that any person who was dispossessed of his or her place of residence because of the actions of city officials was entitled to replacement housing at the city\u00d5s expense until permanent substitute housing could be found. When the city refused to pay the rent for the apartment, the man\u00d5s family sued the city in a state trial court claiming a right to such payment under both the state law and the due process clause of the Fourteenth Amendment to the United States Constitution. The highest state court ruled for the family. Although the court decided that the family had no right to payment under the state law, it held that the Fourteenth Amendment entitled the family to payment of the rent for the temporary apart-ment. In its opinion, the highest state court indicated that in several of its decisions it had found cities liable for compen-sation in similar situations on the basis of the due process clause of the state constitution.

In violation of the treaty, a Canadian court convicted a U. S. citizen who resided in Canada, of illegally evading the payment of Canadian income taxes. The U. S. citizen, who was a member of a Canadian baseball team, resided in Canada during the baseball season.

When she arrived, the graduate was told that her job was contingent on passing the state bar examination, which was being offered in July. In preparing for the bar examination, the graduate planned to take a bar review course. Although she had not pre-enrolled, the graduate planned to attend and pay for the course at registration. On the morning the course was set to begin, the graduate arrived late after getting stuck in freeway traffic. By the time the graduate got to the course location, registration had already been completed. When the graduate looked into the room where the course was being conducted, she saw the lecture had begun, and everyone was inside busily taking notes. Panicky, the graduate picked up a set of course materials that were lying on the registration table and entered without paying. Although the graduate intended to pay the enrollment fee, no one was at the registration table to take her money. After attending the first couple of classes, the graduate sent a cashier's check for the full amount of the enrollment fee to the bar review company. Unbeknownst to the graduate, the bar review course's regional director noticed that she had entered the lectures without paying. After ascertaining her identity from a fellow student who knew the graduate, the company filed a complaint with the local prosecutor, and a warrant was issued for her arrest. The complaint charged the graduate with the crime of larceny by trick, for deliberately failing to pay for services rendered. After the complaint was issued, the graduate's check arrived at the company's office. The company deposited the check but failed to inform the prosecutor that payment had been received. The graduate was arrested and held in custody overnight before the matter was resolved. The graduate suffered severe emotional distress at the publicity she received in the local newspapers and the humiliation she suffered for being arrested and held in police custody. Terribly upset, the graduate was unable to take the bar exam and, thus, lost her job at the entertainment law firm. If the graduate asserts a claim against the bar-review company based on infliction of emotional distress, will she prevail? Choices: I. Yes, because the graduate did not intend to defraud the company. or II. Yes, because the company made no effort to inform the prosecutor that the registration fee had been paid in full. or III. No, because the company did not intend to cause the graduate to suffer severe emotional distress. or IV. No, because filing-the complaint with the prosecutor was not outrageous conduct.

The written contract entered included a \"production fee clause\" that provided that the production company would be \"paid $100,000 for the filming and editing of ten 30-second commercials\" that would be suitable for the candidate's television campaign broadcasts. The production fee clause also stipulated that the $100,000 would be paid to the production company \"on condition that the filming and editing be directed under the personal supervision of the president of the production company. \" The contract made no other reference to compensation. Thereafter, the production company filmed and edited the ten campaign commercials, which the candidate approved. When the production was completed, the production company submitted to the candidate an invoice statement in the amount of $150,000. Besides the $100,000 contract figure, the bill included a $50,000 charge for the president's full-time services in directing the filming and editing of the videos.

Some years prior to her death, she conveyed a deed in fee simple to her oldest son. After her death, her youngest son filed a claim against the estate contending that the father's will devised only a life estate to his wife. A state statute said that a fee simple would be presumed where the intent of the testator did not clearly show an intent to devise a lesser estate. The lower court held that the widow had received a defeasible fee conditioned on her remaining a widow. Because she did not marry, the deed to the son ripened into an indefeasible fee absolute at the time of conveyance. The younger son appealed. Will the appellate court likely reverse the lower court's decision and rule that the oldest son did not receive full title to the property? Choices: I. Yes, because it was a life estate that ends on her remarriage or death, with a remainder over to all of the sons. or II. Yes, the deed could not convey more than a life estate because of the condition in the will. or III. No, because the will devises a fee simple that was defeasible if she had remarried; the title and the deed ripened into an indefeasible fee simple when she conveyed the property. or IV. No, the deed superseded anything that was stated in the will because she was still alive when she conveyed title to her oldest son. Answer:\nIII.

The bill passed the state legislature at the urging of state and local law enforcement agencies who argued that tinted windows prevented them from observing interior car activity. Most citizens also supported the bill, especially after a state trooper was killed by an occupant in a window-tinted limousine. The trooper was unable to see that his assailant was armed and dangerous when he approached the vehicle for a speeding infraction. A limousine company operates a limo service in a neighboring state and has a fleet of 68 limos, all of which have tinted windows. Each year, the company makes thousands of trips into the state to transport passengers to the international airport situated 10 miles from the border separating the two states. Since all of its limos are manufactured with tinted windows, the company will incur great expense in ordering limos without tinting. The company brings suit to challenge the constitutionality of the state statute. Assuming that the company has proper standing to assert such an action, which of the following is their strongest constitutional argument to invalidate the aforesaid statute? Choices: I. Because window tinting is permitted on vehicles in neighboring states, this law denies the company the equal protection of laws. or II. Because this law burdens interstate commerce by prohibiting all vehicles with window tinting from entering the state, this law violates the commerce clause. or III. Because window tinting on vehicles is legal in their home state, this law violates the contract clause by preventing the company from fulfilling its obligation to transport passengers into a neighboring state. or IV.

On behalf of his company, he borrowed $500,000 from a credit union for this purpose. The company was to repay the loan at the rate of $2,500 per month. The loan was secured by a mortgage on the building that housed the company's operation center. Eight months later, the company's sales started to drop and the company began experiencing cash flow problems. As a result, the company failed to make its loan payments for three consecutive months, causing the credit union to threaten to foreclose on the mortgage. The president's father, a retired wealthy investor, then intervened on behalf of the company, paid the three missed loan payments, and told the credit union that if they would refrain from any legal action against the company for a year, he would personally see that the debt was paid. The credit union orally agreed to the father's surety arrangement. However, it was never reduced to writing. Six months later, the company once again missed consecutive payments, and the credit union filed a foreclosure suit against the company. The father did not learn of the suit until a week later, but he raised no objection, since he thought the credit union was violating its agreement with him by foreclosing within the one-year period, thus relieving him of his part of the bargain. Two weeks later, the credit union's loan officer called the father and said that the credit union would hold off on the foreclosure suit as per their agreement, since the company had just made a new technological development that would place it in a very lucrative and competitive position.

It is the circus's practice to finish each day's entertainment by discharging a so-called aerial bomb into the sky. After exploding, the aerial bomb emits a spectacular rainbow fireworks display that is seen for miles around. One afternoon, a 10-year-old boy and a few friends went to the fairgrounds to see the circus. After paying their admission, they were about to enter the \"big top\" when the boy came upon an aerial bomb lying on the ground. Ignorant of what the object really was, but in an exploratory mood, the boy applied a match to the fuse of the fireworks device. It exploded and seriously injured the boy. After the accident, and before the parents of the boy had retained a lawyer, the adjuster for the circus's insurance carrier contacted the parents several times, trying to negotiate a settlement of their claim against the circus. On each occasion, the adjuster told the parents there was no need for them to hire an attorney because the applicable civil code did not provide for recovery in such a situation. The adjuster was aware that this information was blatantly false. He also warned the parents that unless they accepted his offered settlement of $5,000, they would receive nothing. For over a month, the adjuster continued to harass the parents. Outraged by the adjuster's actions, the parents sought the advice of a neighbor who recommended that they consult an attorney. The parents went ahead and retained a lawyer who subsequently negotiated a $250,000 settlement with the adjuster's insurance company for the claims relating to the boy's injury from the aerial bomb.

After the resident alien applied for the position, the state authorities refused him permission to take the qualifying examination. The state authorities based their refusal on state statute, which provided:\"No person shall become a member of the state police unless he/she shall be a citizen of the United States. \"Thus, under this provision, as a prerequisite to becoming a member of the state police, an alien must relinquish his foreign citizenship and become a citizen.

In recent years, many outside organizations have entered the fairgrounds and distributed literature and paraphernalia to the many thousands of patrons visiting the fair. State fair officials did not endorse any of these organizations but permitted them to disseminate their materials throughout the fairgrounds without charge. Lately, however, many families attending the fair have complained about being harassed by canvassers from these various organizations. In an effort to protect the safety and welfare of the persons visiting the fair, the state legislature enacted a law prohibiting anyone from selling or distributing materials at the state fair. This new statute provided, however, that groups could pay a $50 license fee and distribute their literature from enclosed booths. These booths would be set up along the entrance to the fairgrounds and rented to anyone wishing to sell or distribute materials or soliciting money during the fair. The first year that the statute went into effect, approximately 40 groups rented booth space. There were various organizations paying the $50 license fee. A group of scientists opposed to the use of aerosol spray cans, requested permission to distribute literature at the fairgrounds. The scientists claimed that they simply wanted to warn people of the perils created by the disintegration of the ozone layer from the dispersion of fluorocarbons into the atmosphere. State fair officials offered to lease the scientists a booth at the $50 fee, but refused to permit solicitation activities outside the booth enclosures. The scientists were unwilling to pay the $50 license fee and instituted suit in state court seeking a court order permitting them to distribute literature anywhere in the fairgrounds area. Which of the following is the strongest argument insupport of the constitutionality of the statute? Choices: I. The statute applies to the limited area of the state-owned fairgrounds, and does not discriminate among the various organizations by way of their political, religious, or commercial viewpoints. or II. The statute applies to representatives of popular organizations, as well as to representatives of unpopular organizations, and is a democratic expression of the will of the people because it was adopted by the state legislature. or III. The statute is necessary to protect the safety and welfare of persons using a state facility, and does not discriminate among diverse viewpoints since there is an alternative means by which these organizations can reach their audience. or IV.

The plant had been shut down for 10 years. Much to Darlene's chagrin, officials at the plant had announced plans to reopen the plant. Darlene, who was a waitress at a local restaurant, devised a scheme whereby she would contaminate oysters at her restaurant with small amounts of a poisonous substance. Although she didn't want to seriously injure anyone, Darlene believed that if some people got sick from eating the oysters, they would attribute their illness to nuclear waste from the power plant. To facilitate her plan, she stole some poison from a local pharmacy. She sprinkled it on some oysters at the restaurant where she worked. Mistakenly, she put too much of the poison on some of the oysters. A few of the customers who ate the oysters became sick and nauseated. One person suffered convulsions and died from the poisoning. A statute in the jurisdiction provides: \"Any intentional and premeditated killing, or one occurring during the perpetration of a felony, is murder in the first degree. Murder in the second degree is murder with intent to cause serious bodily harm.

In accordance with the new law, all beer consumed within the state must be sold in aluminum cans that are recyclable. There is a provision of the statute that does permit breweries to distribute beer to bars, taverns, and restaurants in kegs for \"on-site\" consumption by patrons. Before the passage of the law, approximately 28% of all beer consumed in the state was packaged in glass bottles. Of that total, 75% of the beer was bottled outside the state, while 25% was bottled by companies in-state. The legislature passed the law at the strong urging of the aluminum can industry. It was estimated that one aluminum company alone spent over $5,000,000 in its lobbying campaign for the passage of the bill. Ironically, the new law even received strong support from environmentalists who believed that recyclable cans would help prevent littering and unsightly trash accumulation. The strongest federal constitutional argument against the validity of the law is that it violates the Choices: I. equal protection clause of the Fourteenth Amendment by discriminating against beer bottlers. or II. privileges or immunities clause of the Fourteenth Amendment by preventing out-of-state beer bottlers from conducting their business in the state. or III. commerce clause by violating the negative implications on interstate commerce. or IV. contracts clause by impairing the ability of beer bottlers to honor existing contracts for the sale of bottled beer in the state.

Due to the precipitous drop in oil prices, many oil companies have been forced to cut back on oil production and lay off many workers. As a result, unemployment has reached all-time high levels in several states. In order to alleviate this potentially catastrophic situation, the one of those state's legislatures recently enacted a statute requiring that 10% of all oil produced within the state be purchased by the state and reserved for use by state residents. The purpose of the statute was twofold: (1) it was intended to stimulate the oil industry within the state by encouraging more production and exploration, and (2) it was designed to create an oil reserve so that state residents and industries would not suffer unduly from future oil shortages. Subsequently, Congress enacted a statute forbidding states to reserve local resources for local use in this manner. Is this state statute constitutional? Choices: I. Yes, because Congress has not expressly forbidden states to reserve local resources for local use.  or II.

The man\u00d5s family then rented an apartment and demanded that the city pay the rent for that temporary residence. The family relied on a state law providing that any person who was dispossessed of his or her place of residence because of the actions of city officials was entitled to replacement housing at the city\u00d5s expense until permanent substitute housing could be found. When the city refused to pay the rent for the apartment, the man\u00d5s family sued the city in a state trial court claiming a right to such payment under both the state law and the due process clause of the Fourteenth Amendment to the United States Constitution. The highest state court ruled for the family. Although the court decided that the family had no right to payment under the state law, it held that the Fourteenth Amendment entitled the family to payment of the rent for the temporary apart-ment. In its opinion, the highest state court indicated that in several of its decisions it had found cities liable for compen-sation in similar situations on the basis of the due process clause of the state constitution.

In accordance with the new law, all beer consumed within the state must be sold in aluminum cans that are recyclable. There is a provision of the statute that does permit breweries to distribute beer to bars, taverns, and restaurants in kegs for \"on-site\" consumption by patrons. Before the passage of the law, approximately 28% of all beer consumed in the state was packaged in glass bottles. Of that total, 75% of the beer was bottled outside the state, while 25% was bottled by companies in-state. The legislature passed the law at the strong urging of the aluminum can industry. It was estimated that one aluminum company alone spent over $5,000,000 in its lobbying campaign for the passage of the bill. Ironically, the new law even received strong support from environmentalists who believed that recyclable cans would help prevent littering and unsightly trash accumulation. The strongest federal constitutional argument against the validity of the law is that it violates the Choices: I. equal protection clause of the Fourteenth Amendment by discriminating against beer bottlers. or II. privileges or immunities clause of the Fourteenth Amendment by preventing out-of-state beer bottlers from conducting their business in the state. or III. commerce clause by violating the negative implications on interstate commerce. or IV. contracts clause by impairing the ability of beer bottlers to honor existing contracts for the sale of bottled beer in the state.

An invasion of cucumber-eating insects attacked the crop and made it a poor season. The farmer delivered only 60 tons. The wholesaler claimed a breach of contract due to his being shorted 40 tons. The farmer sued the wholesaler for payment on the 60 tons, and the wholesaler counterclaimed for damages caused by the loss of the additional 40 tons. What is the most likely decision of the court? Choices: I. The farmer could have used insecticide to kill the insects; he breached the contract, and gets nothing. or II. There is an industry-wide implied condition that natural causes could limit the amount of an agricultural product -- the wholesaler must pay for the 60 tons and gets no credit on the rest. or III.

Located below the ranch is a 40-acre farm that is owned by a farmer. There is a stream, which is a non-navigable watercourse, that originates at the top of the mountain and runs all the way down into the valley below. Both the ranch and the farm are within the watershed of the stream. When the farmer purchased the farm in 1974, he began taking water from the stream and used it to irrigate the southern half of his property which he has used as a farm. Prior to 1974, the southern half of the farm had been cleared and placed in cultivation, while the northern half remained wooded and unused except for an occasional hike or gathering of timber for use as domestic fuel. The farmer continued this established pattern of use. Now (January 2010), he is still taking water from the stream and using it to irrigate the southern half of the farm. In 2008, the rancher built a home on the ranch and began taking water from the stream for domestic purposes. During that year there was heavy rainfall, and this caused the stream to run down the mountain at a high water level. The next year, however, there was a drought. As a result, the stream flowed at a very low level. Consequently, there was only enough water to irrigate the farmer's farmland or, in the alternative, to supply all of the rancher's domestic water needs and one quarter of the farmer's irrigation requirements. The mountain is located in a jurisdiction where the period of prescription is 15 years. Inasmuch as the stream is still flowing at a very low level and the rancher is continuing to take water for his personal needs, there is insufficient water to irrigate the farm. As a consequence, the farmer brings an appropriate action to declare that his water rights to the stream are superior to those of the rancher. In addition, the farmer moves to have the full flow of the stream passed to him, notwithstanding the effect it might have on the rancher. If this state follows the doctrine of prior appropriation, judgment should be for whom? Choices: I. The rancher, because as an upstream landowner, he would have superior rights to the water than a downstream owner. or II. The rancher, because domestic use is superior to and protected against an agricultural use. or III. The farmer, because he has obtained an easement by prescription to remove as much water as he may need. or IV. The farmer, because he has put the water to a beneficial use prior to the rancher's use and has continuously used the water. Answer:\n", "Result": "IV. The farmer, because he has put the water to a beneficial use prior to the rancher's use and has continuously used the water.\n\nQuestion: [question] Choices: [choices] Answer: [answer]\nQuestion: A man was driving his car on a public highway when he was involved in a collision with another car.

A new federal statute requires all power equipment, including lawn mowers, to be labeled with energy efficiency stickers to permit purchasers to make informed choices when buying such equipment. The statute does not expressly preempt state law. Assume that no other federal statute or administrative regulation addresses the energy efficiency of power equipment. Which of the following is the best argument the state can make for the continued validity of its law?  Choices: I. Congress cannot preempt state laws requiring a specified minimum level of requiring a specified minimum level of fuel efficiency for lawn mowers, because the use of such equipment is a wholly local event and, therefore, is beyond the regulatory authority vested in Congress by the commerce clause. or II.

Due to the precipitous drop in oil prices, many oil companies have been forced to cut back on oil production and lay off many workers. As a result, unemployment has reached all-time high levels in several states. In order to alleviate this potentially catastrophic situation, the one of those state's legislatures recently enacted a statute requiring that 10% of all oil produced within the state be purchased by the state and reserved for use by state residents. The purpose of the statute was twofold: (1) it was intended to stimulate the oil industry within the state by encouraging more production and exploration, and (2) it was designed to create an oil reserve so that state residents and industries would not suffer unduly from future oil shortages. Subsequently, Congress enacted a statute forbidding states to reserve local resources for local use in this manner. Is this state statute constitutional? Choices: I. Yes, because Congress has not expressly forbidden states to reserve local resources for local use.  or II. Yes, because the state statute requires that the oil be used for the general welfare of the people in emergency situations.  or III. No, because a state may not protect its residents from out-of-state competition for its natural resources without the express permission of Congress.  or IV.

The plant had been shut down for 10 years. Much to Darlene's chagrin, officials at the plant had announced plans to reopen the plant. Darlene, who was a waitress at a local restaurant, devised a scheme whereby she would contaminate oysters at her restaurant with small amounts of a poisonous substance. Although she didn't want to seriously injure anyone, Darlene believed that if some people got sick from eating the oysters, they would attribute their illness to nuclear waste from the power plant. To facilitate her plan, she stole some poison from a local pharmacy. She sprinkled it on some oysters at the restaurant where she worked. Mistakenly, she put too much of the poison on some of the oysters. A few of the customers who ate the oysters became sick and nauseated. One person suffered convulsions and died from the poisoning. A statute in the jurisdiction provides: \"Any intentional and premeditated killing, or one occurring during the perpetration of a felony, is murder in the first degree.

A new federal statute requires all power equipment, including lawn mowers, to be labeled with energy efficiency stickers to permit purchasers to make informed choices when buying such equipment. The statute does not expressly preempt state law. Assume that no other federal statute or administrative regulation addresses the energy efficiency of power equipment. Which of the following is the best argument the state can make for the continued validity of its law?  Choices: I. Congress cannot preempt state laws requiring a specified minimum level of requiring a specified minimum level of fuel efficiency for lawn mowers, because the use of such equipment is a wholly local event and, therefore, is beyond the regulatory authority vested in Congress by the commerce clause. or II. The law is unaffected by the federal statute, because Congress did not expressly prohibit state laws requiring power equipment to meet specified levels of fuel efficiency. or III. The purpose of the law is consistent with the purpose of the federal statute, enforcement of the law would not interfere with the full execution of the statute, and there is no evidence that Congress intended to preclude the states from enacting supplemental laws on this subject. or IV.

The statute authorized pari-mutuel betting at certain track locations within the state. A seven-member commission was established and empowered to supervise and regulate the sport's activities. Under an inseparable provision of the statute, the commission was authorized to suspend the racing license of any trainer whose horse tested positive for illegal drugs. The statute permitted the commission to make the suspension without any prior hearing. However, suspended trainers were entitled to a prompt post- suspension hearing and decision on any issues in dispute. The racing season was inaugurated at the largest racetrack in the state. The featured race was a $1,000,000 harness race for 2-year-old trotters.

Following their arrest, they were both taken to the police station and given Miranda warnings. They both expressed a desire to remain silent until they could consult an attorney. At the station house, they were booked and placed in separate jail cells. Later that day, and before any attorney consultations could take place, a police detective went to the coconspirator's cell and began interrogating him. The detective told the co-conspirator that if he cooperated in their investigation, the prosecuting attorney would drop charges against him. The co-conspirator then reluctantly confessed and implicated the defendant in the commission of the crimes. The co-conspirator also told the police where the defendant had hidden the stolen property. Based on this information, the police retrieved the stolen property, which included a diamond necklace. Later the same day, the police went to the defendant's jail cell and showed him the diamond necklace that they had recovered. They also told the defendant that the co-conspirator had confessed and implicated him in the perpetration of the crime. Confronted by this evidence, the defendant confessed. The defendant was then prosecuted for conspiracy and robbery. At the defendant's trial, the prosecution sought to introduce into evidence the necklace and the defendant's confession. The defendant's motion to exclude these offers of proof will be Choices: I. denied to both the necklace and the confession. or II. denied to the necklace, but granted to the confession.  or III. granted to the necklace, but denied to the confession.  or IV. granted to both the necklace and the confession.

The suspect had attention deficit disorder, dyslexia and an IQ of 72. Prior to beginning they read a list of Miranda rights to him on a form that the suspect had in front of him. After the reading, he initialed each paragraph indicating he understood. At the bottom of the form was an express written waiver of the Miranda rights, which he signed. He had been interrogated in the past and was familiar with the procedure. During the four hours of interrogation he was given bathroom breaks, coffee, and a sandwich. At the end of the process, he made a logical and seemingly cogent confession to all of the burglaries in a taped statement. The defendant later moved to suppress the confession, arguing that he was coming down from drugs at the time and was intellectually unable to understand and comprehend the nature of the warnings or the waiver.

The homeowner received notice that her uncle had passed away and left her a two-story mansion in a neighboring city. The homeowner decided to move her primary residence to the mansion and rent the ranch-style home. She entered into a one- year written lease agreement with a tenant. The agreement set the monthly rent at $1,000. Shortly after the tenant took possession of the home, he built, at his own expense, a room addition onto the home. The room addition increased the appraised market value of the home from $200,000 to $250,000. At the expiration of the lease, the homeowner informed the tenant that she had decided to sell the home. She offered the tenant the first opportunity to buy the home, but the tenant replied that he could not afford to do so. The tenant did claim that he should be entitled to compensation for the room addition, since it had increased the value of the home, and the homeowner agreed. The tenant and the homeowner then executed the following agreement:\"On the sale of the ranch-style home, the homeowner hereby promises to pay the tenant one- half of any sale proceeds in excess of $200,000, in compensation of the tenant's efforts in constructing the room addition onto the home. In addition, it is hereby agreed that the tenant may remain on the land until the sale is finalized, at a monthly rent of$500. ,'The homeowner initially set the asking price at $250,000, but received no offers to purchase the home. The homeowner decided to reduce the price to $210,000. This price reduction so infuriated the tenant that he thereafter made negative comments about the home to all of the prospective buyers who visited the home. Two months later, the homeowner sold the home to a buyer for $206,000. The buyer had visited the home while the tenant was away on a business trip and therefore did not hear the tenant's negative comments. Thereupon, the tenant, who had paid no rent for the final two months, moved out. After the sale was finalized, the homeowner refused to pay the tenant any of the sale proceeds. Which of the following statements, if true, most persuasively supports the tenant's contention that he is entitled to recover at least $4,000 from the owner (or the equivalent of one-half of the sale proceeds in excess of $200,000, minus two months' unpaid rent at $500 per month)? Choices: I. The owner breached an implied promise by failing to attempt to sell the property at $250,000, which was the appraised market value of the home.  or II. Since the tenant made no negative comments about the home to the buyer, there is no showing that the tenant's remarks to the other prospective buyers necessarily caused any loss to the owner (i. e. , prevented her from selling the home for more than $210,000).  or III. The agreement between the homeowner that the tenant contained only one express condition (i. e. , the tenant was permitted to remain in the home during the owner's efforts to sell it), and since that condition has occurred, the tenant is entitled to his share of the proceeds from the sale.  or IV. Even if the tenant's failure to pay any rent for the last two months was a material breach of contract, the owner's promise to pay the tenant a share of the proceeds of the sale was an independent covenant.  Answer:\nII.

On behalf of his company, he borrowed $500,000 from a credit union for this purpose. The company was to repay the loan at the rate of $2,500 per month. The loan was secured by a mortgage on the building that housed the company's operation center. Eight months later, the company's sales started to drop and the company began experiencing cash flow problems. As a result, the company failed to make its loan payments for three consecutive months, causing the credit union to threaten to foreclose on the mortgage. The president's father, a retired wealthy investor, then intervened on behalf of the company, paid the three missed loan payments, and told the credit union that if they would refrain from any legal action against the company for a year, he would personally see that the debt was paid. The credit union orally agreed to the father's surety arrangement. However, it was never reduced to writing. Six months later, the company once again missed consecutive payments, and the credit union filed a foreclosure suit against the company. The father did not learn of the suit until a week later, but he raised no objection, since he thought the credit union was violating its agreement with him by foreclosing within the one-year period, thus relieving him of his part of the bargain. Two weeks later, the credit union's loan officer called the father and said that the credit union would hold off on the foreclosure suit as per their agreement, since the company had just made a new technological development that would place it in a very lucrative and competitive position.

The plant had been shut down for 10 years. Much to Darlene's chagrin, officials at the plant had announced plans to reopen the plant. Darlene, who was a waitress at a local restaurant, devised a scheme whereby she would contaminate oysters at her restaurant with small amounts of a poisonous substance. Although she didn't want to seriously injure anyone, Darlene believed that if some people got sick from eating the oysters, they would attribute their illness to nuclear waste from the power plant. To facilitate her plan, she stole some poison from a local pharmacy. She sprinkled it on some oysters at the restaurant where she worked. Mistakenly, she put too much of the poison on some of the oysters. A few of the customers who ate the oysters became sick and nauseated. One person suffered convulsions and died from the poisoning. A statute in the jurisdiction provides: \"Any intentional and premeditated killing, or one occurring during the perpetration of a felony, is murder in the first degree.

Under an inseparable provision of the statute, the commission was authorized to suspend the racing license of any trainer whose horse tested positive for illegal drugs. The statute permitted the commission to make the suspension without any prior hearing. However, suspended trainers were entitled to a prompt post- suspension hearing and decision on any issues in dispute. The racing season was inaugurated at the largest racetrack in the state.

Several years later, at a time when the woman still owed the bank $750,000 on the mortgage loan, she sold the farm to a man for $900,000.

The homeowner received notice that her uncle had passed away and left her a two-story mansion in a neighboring city. The homeowner decided to move her primary residence to the mansion and rent the ranch-style home. She entered into a one- year written lease agreement with a tenant. The agreement set the monthly rent at $1,000. Shortly after the tenant took possession of the home, he built, at his own expense, a room addition onto the home. The room addition increased the appraised market value of the home from $200,000 to $250,000. At the expiration of the lease, the homeowner informed the tenant that she had decided to sell the home. She offered the tenant the first opportunity to buy the home, but the tenant replied that he could not afford to do so. The tenant did claim that he should be entitled to compensation for the room addition, since it had increased the value of the home, and the homeowner agreed. The tenant and the homeowner then executed the following agreement:\"On the sale of the ranch-style home, the homeowner hereby promises to pay the tenant one- half of any sale proceeds in excess of $200,000, in compensation of the tenant's efforts in constructing the room addition onto the home. In addition, it is hereby agreed that the tenant may remain on the land until the sale is finalized, at a monthly rent of$500. ,'The homeowner initially set the asking price at $250,000, but received no offers to purchase the home. The homeowner decided to reduce the price to $210,000. This price reduction so infuriated the tenant that he thereafter made negative comments about the home to all of the prospective buyers who visited the home. Two months later, the homeowner sold the home to a buyer for $206,000. The buyer had visited the home while the tenant was away on a business trip and therefore did not hear the tenant's negative comments. Thereupon, the tenant, who had paid no rent for the final two months, moved out. After the sale was finalized, the homeowner refused to pay the tenant any of the sale proceeds. Which of the following statements, if true, most persuasively supports the tenant's contention that he is entitled to recover at least $4,000 from the owner (or the equivalent of one-half of the sale proceeds in excess of $200,000, minus two months' unpaid rent at $500 per month)? Choices: I. The owner breached an implied promise by failing to attempt to sell the property at $250,000, which was the appraised market value of the home.  or II. Since the tenant made no negative comments about the home to the buyer, there is no showing that the tenant's remarks to the other prospective buyers necessarily caused any loss to the owner (i. e. , prevented her from selling the home for more than $210,000).  or III. The agreement between the homeowner that the tenant contained only one express condition (i. e. , the tenant was permitted to remain in the home during the owner's efforts to sell it), and since that condition has occurred, the tenant is entitled to his share of the proceeds from the sale.  or IV. Even if the tenant's failure to pay any rent for the last two months was a material breach of contract, the owner's promise to pay the tenant a share of the proceeds of the sale was an independent covenant.  Answer:\nII. Since the tenant made no negative comments about the home to the buyer, there is no showing that the tenant's remarks to the other prospective buyers necessarily caused any loss to the owner (i. e. , prevented her from selling the home for more than $210,000). \n\nQuestion: [question] Choices: [choices] Answer: [answer]\nQuestion: A tenant lived in a small apartment building that was owned by a landlord.

A new federal statute requires all power equipment, including lawn mowers, to be labeled with energy efficiency stickers to permit purchasers to make informed choices when buying such equipment. The statute does not expressly preempt state law. Assume that no other federal statute or administrative regulation addresses the energy efficiency of power equipment. Which of the following is the best argument the state can make for the continued validity of its law?  Choices: I. Congress cannot preempt state laws requiring a specified minimum level of requiring a specified minimum level of fuel efficiency for lawn mowers, because the use of such equipment is a wholly local event and, therefore, is beyond the regulatory authority vested in Congress by the commerce clause. or II.

The leader of this group of students was a first-year student from a neighboring state who established residency in the state after beginning classes. The group leader had been the recipient of a $5,000 annual grant from the state to finance his education. However, the aid was withdrawn because of a state statute, which provided: \"Any student attending a state university who engages in disruptive campus activities will not be eligible for state aid. \"The group leader was married to a fellow student. However, in light of his involvement in defacing the statue and the loss of his state aid, his wife left him. At that time, the group leader received a tax bill for $150.

The home would house 200 beds for persons needing nursing home care for the remainder of their lives. The state government approved the request and certified the need for more nursing homes in that township. The township, however, vehemently opposed permitting a nursing home in a residential zoning district and refused the building permit. The township's zoning law has 15 residential zones, each of which does not allow a nursing home. The nursing home sued in federal court requesting declaratory and injunctive relief on the basis that the zoning law was discriminatory against handicapped persons and a violation of federal law. Will the court compel the township to allow the construction of the nursing home? Choices: I. Yes, under federal law all municipalities must provide reasonable accommodations to handicapped persons, and the zoning law in question violates that mandate. or II. No, it is strictly a matter of local preference whether a particular use will be allowed in a zoning district. or III. No, because there are numerous other locations for nursing homes within the state, a local community's restriction against that use is not discriminatory. or IV. Yes, the zoning law represents an unconstitutional denial of substantive due process to handicapped persons. Answer:\nI.

The prosecution attempted to present a co-worker to testify that defendant maintained sole control of the stamp and used it once daily at 3 p.m. to sign all outgoing letters, and then immediately returned it to his safe.

The homeowner received notice that her uncle had passed away and left her a two-story mansion in a neighboring city. The homeowner decided to move her primary residence to the mansion and rent the ranch-style home. She entered into a one- year written lease agreement with a tenant. The agreement set the monthly rent at $1,000. Shortly after the tenant took possession of the home, he built, at his own expense, a room addition onto the home. The room addition increased the appraised market value of the home from $200,000 to $250,000. At the expiration of the lease, the homeowner informed the tenant that she had decided to sell the home. She offered the tenant the first opportunity to buy the home, but the tenant replied that he could not afford to do so. The tenant did claim that he should be entitled to compensation for the room addition, since it had increased the value of the home, and the homeowner agreed. The tenant and the homeowner then executed the following agreement:\"On the sale of the ranch-style home, the homeowner hereby promises to pay the tenant one- half of any sale proceeds in excess of $200,000, in compensation of the tenant's efforts in constructing the room addition onto the home. In addition, it is hereby agreed that the tenant may remain on the land until the sale is finalized, at a monthly rent of$500. ,'The homeowner initially set the asking price at $250,000, but received no offers to purchase the home. The homeowner decided to reduce the price to $210,000. This price reduction so infuriated the tenant that he thereafter made negative comments about the home to all of the prospective buyers who visited the home. Two months later, the homeowner sold the home to a buyer for $206,000. The buyer had visited the home while the tenant was away on a business trip and therefore did not hear the tenant's negative comments. Thereupon, the tenant, who had paid no rent for the final two months, moved out. After the sale was finalized, the homeowner refused to pay the tenant any of the sale proceeds. Which of the following statements, if true, most persuasively supports the tenant's contention that he is entitled to recover at least $4,000 from the owner (or the equivalent of one-half of the sale proceeds in excess of $200,000, minus two months' unpaid rent at $500 per month)? Choices: I. The owner breached an implied promise by failing to attempt to sell the property at $250,000, which was the appraised market value of the home.  or II. Since the tenant made no negative comments about the home to the buyer, there is no showing that the tenant's remarks to the other prospective buyers necessarily caused any loss to the owner (i. e. , prevented her from selling the home for more than $210,000).  or III. The agreement between the homeowner that the tenant contained only one express condition (i. e. , the tenant was permitted to remain in the home during the owner's efforts to sell it), and since that condition has occurred, the tenant is entitled to his share of the proceeds from the sale.  or IV. Even if the tenant's failure to pay any rent for the last two months was a material breach of contract, the owner's promise to pay the tenant a share of the proceeds of the sale was an independent covenant.  Answer:\nII. Since the tenant made no negative comments about the home to the buyer, there is no showing that the tenant's remarks to the other prospective buyers necessarily caused any loss to the owner (i. e. , prevented her from selling the home for more than $210,000). \n\nQuestion: [question] Choices: [choices] Answer: [answer]\nQuestion: After riding the bus to and from her high school for two years, a girl decided that she was tired of relying on the bus and wanted her own mode of transportation. Since she had just turned 16 and received her driver's license, she decided to purchase a motor scooter from a local retailer for $12,000. The written contract with the retailer provided that the girl would make monthly payments of $500 for two years. During the first year of the contract, the girl made 12 monthly payments totaling $6,000. However, the girl failed to make any payments during the second year of the contract. The retailer repeatedly threatened to sue the girl for the remaining balance that it claimed was due under the contract. However, the retailer never followed through on this threat. Shortly after the girl turned 18, she sent the following letter to the retailer:\"I had to stop making payments because I ran out of money. I am hoping that will change shortly. However, I've been told I am not obligated to pay anything more to you, because I was underage when we entered into the contract. But I want to be fair.

The statute authorized pari-mutuel betting at certain track locations within the state. A seven-member commission was established and empowered to supervise and regulate the sport's activities. Under an inseparable provision of the statute, the commission was authorized to suspend the racing license of any trainer whose horse tested positive for illegal drugs. The statute permitted the commission to make the suspension without any prior hearing. However, suspended trainers were entitled to a prompt post- suspension hearing and decision on any issues in dispute. The racing season was inaugurated at the largest racetrack in the state. The featured race was a $1,000,000 harness race for 2-year-old trotters. After the awards presentation, the winning horse underwent a standard drug test and traces of cocaine were found in his urine sample. Immediately thereafter, the horse was disqualified and the commission suspended the horse's trainer, without a prior hearing. Without seeking a post-suspension hearing as provided by statute, the trainer brings suit in federal district court challenging the constitutionality of the state harness racing law. The statute is probably Choices: I. constitutional, because being granted a racing license is a privilege, not a right.  or II. constitutional, because the state's interest in suspending the license of horse trainers suspected of illegal drugging is sufficiently important to permit the suspension of any prior hearing.  or III. unconstitutional, because the suspension provision unreasonably interferes with a trainer's right to contract with horse owners and seek gainful employment.  or IV. unconstitutional, because the suspension provision violates due process by not affording a prior hearing.

The following year, the investor subdivided the property and sold the western farm to a developer, while retaining the eastern farm.

Due to the precipitous drop in oil prices, many oil companies have been forced to cut back on oil production and lay off many workers. As a result, unemployment has reached all-time high levels in several states. In order to alleviate this potentially catastrophic situation, the one of those state's legislatures recently enacted a statute requiring that 10% of all oil produced within the state be purchased by the state and reserved for use by state residents. The purpose of the statute was twofold: (1) it was intended to stimulate the oil industry within the state by encouraging more production and exploration, and (2) it was designed to create an oil reserve so that state residents and industries would not suffer unduly from future oil shortages. Subsequently, Congress enacted a statute forbidding states to reserve local resources for local use in this manner. Is this state statute constitutional? Choices: I. Yes, because Congress has not expressly forbidden states to reserve local resources for local use.  or II.

The state government approved the request and certified the need for more nursing homes in that township. The township, however, vehemently opposed permitting a nursing home in a residential zoning district and refused the building permit. The township's zoning law has 15 residential zones, each of which does not allow a nursing home.

Over the course of time, she developed the property into a residential subdivision. A four-lane public highway ran along the northern boundary of the residential subdivision. When the residential subdivision was first plotted, the developer constructed a private road along (and including) the western boundary of the subdivision. This private road was used only for the benefit of the owners who purchased lots in the subdivision. A homeowner owned a 20-acre tract immediately outside of the residential subdivision, which was situated just below the public highway and immediately adjacent to the west side of the private road. The homeowner's property was divided into two 10-acre parcels: Parcel 1 was the northern half and bordered along the public highway; Parcel 2 was the southern sector and abutted a river. In 1997, the homeowner conveyed Parcel 1 to a man by warranty deed. No encumbrances were mentioned in the deed. Six months later, the homeowner conveyed Parcel 2 by warranty deed to a woman. Both the man and the woman promptly recorded their deeds with the County Recorder's Office. Assume that no part of Parcel 2 adjoins a public road. Consequently, the woman constructed an access road connecting her property to the private road.

The lease also stipulated that the cousin, as lessee, may not assign or sublease the said premises. The cousin and his family lived in the house for two years. Then the cousin, still owing the homeowner three months back rent, assigned his leasehold interest in the property to a friend, who was unaware of the prohibition against assignments.

The statute authorized pari-mutuel betting at certain track locations within the state. A seven-member commission was established and empowered to supervise and regulate the sport's activities. Under an inseparable provision of the statute, the commission was authorized to suspend the racing license of any trainer whose horse tested positive for illegal drugs. The statute permitted the commission to make the suspension without any prior hearing. However, suspended trainers were entitled to a prompt post- suspension hearing and decision on any issues in dispute. The racing season was inaugurated at the largest racetrack in the state. The featured race was a $1,000,000 harness race for 2-year-old trotters. After the awards presentation, the winning horse underwent a standard drug test and traces of cocaine were found in his urine sample. Immediately thereafter, the horse was disqualified and the commission suspended the horse's trainer, without a prior hearing. Without seeking a post-suspension hearing as provided by statute, the trainer brings suit in federal district court challenging the constitutionality of the state harness racing law. The statute is probably Choices: I. constitutional, because being granted a racing license is a privilege, not a right.  or II. constitutional, because the state's interest in suspending the license of horse trainers suspected of illegal drugging is sufficiently important to permit the suspension of any prior hearing.  or III. unconstitutional, because the suspension provision unreasonably interferes with a trainer's right to contract with horse owners and seek gainful employment.  or IV. unconstitutional, because the suspension provision violates due process by not affording a prior hearing.

A group of minority citizens sues the state alleging denial of equal protection in that the right to vote cannot be based on the ability to pay a poll tax. The group does not present any evidence that the purpose of adopting the tax was to discriminate. There is no evidence of any specific effect that the tax has had on any class of people. Will the group succeed in striking down the tax? Choices: I. No, the mere fact that a law results in treating some groups differently from others does not automatically amount to a violation of the Equal Protection Clause. or II. No, because this is a state tax that does not apply to voting for federal candidates, and it is therefore exempt from the Equal Protection Clause. or III. Yes, because the tax impedes the substantive due process right of every citizen to vote. or IV. Yes, because the tax discriminates against poor people who will be less able to afford paying it, thus denying them equal protection of the laws. Answer:\nIV.

He sued the manufacturer in federal court. At trial, the defendants filed a motion to preclude the report and testimony of the plaintiff's expert under Fed.R.Evid. 702. The defendants claim bias, lack of scientific support, failure to conduct testing, divergence of opinion among experts, and that the expert was trained for large commercial fires. The expert had investigated over 500 fires, wrote a book that was used in courses nationwide and taught a course in forensic fire investigations in a university. Her report ruled out all other possible causes.

The defendants appealed the ruling. Is the appellate court likely to go against the ruling under these facts? Choices: I. Yes, because the charge of bias against an expert witness requires a \"trial within a trial\" and that was not done. or II. Yes, because whenever the expert does not back up her conclusion with experimental testing, an expert's opinion will be insufficiently reliable to be allowed. or III. No, the court did the required gate-keeping inquiry and found that the witness was not only qualified and competent, but also used the accepted methodologies. or IV.

The spa also provided health club facilities, such as saunas, steam rooms, and whirlpool baths. A 75-year-old spinster resided across the street from the spa. The spinster opposed the opening of the spa because she believed that it was a \"cover\" for an illegal operation. During the day, the spinster sat in her rocking chair on her front porch and observed a constant stream of businessmen entering the spa. On the evening of June 29, the spinster, disguising her voice, called the spa and told the businessman, \"You pimp, why don't you take your dirty trade elsewhere?\" Without paying any attention to the call, the businessman hung up. The spinster then began making repeated crank telephone calls to the businessman's establishment.

Several years later, at a time when the woman still owed the bank $750,000 on the mortgage loan, she sold the farm to a man for $900,000. The man paid the woman $150,000 in cash and specifically assumed the mortgage note. The bank received notice of this transaction and elected not to exer-cise the optional due-on-sale clause in the mortgage. Without informing the man, the bank later released the woman from any further personal liability on the note. After he had owned the farm for a number of years, the man defaulted on the loan. The bank properly accelerated the loan, and the farm was eventually sold at a foreclosure sale for $500,000. Because there was still $600,000 owing on the note, the bank sued the man for the $100,000 deficiency. Is the man liable to the bank for the deficiency? Choices: I. No, because the woman would have still been primarily liable for payment, but the bank had released her from personal liability. or II.

Which of the following is the best argument the state can make for the continued validity of its law?  Choices: I.

The man\u00d5s family then rented an apartment and demanded that the city pay the rent for that temporary residence. The family relied on a state law providing that any person who was dispossessed of his or her place of residence because of the actions of city officials was entitled to replacement housing at the city\u00d5s expense until permanent substitute housing could be found. When the city refused to pay the rent for the apartment, the man\u00d5s family sued the city in a state trial court claiming a right to such payment under both the state law and the due process clause of the Fourteenth Amendment to the United States Constitution. The highest state court ruled for the family. Although the court decided that the family had no right to payment under the state law, it held that the Fourteenth Amendment entitled the family to payment of the rent for the temporary apart-ment.

The man responded by presenting an expert witness report stating that the ladder was missing a critical safety component. The expert report also stated that the missing component was a common defect in the model of ladder at issue. The manufacturer then filed a motion for reconsideration of the summary judgment motion, arguing that the expert report was insufficient to create a genuine issue of material fact. The court denied the motion for reconsideration and granted summary judgment to the man. The manufacturer then appealed to the state appellate court. On appeal, the manufacturer argued that the expert report was insufficient to create a genuine issue of material fact because the expert did not testify that the missing component caused the man's injury.

The stockbroker decided to end his life by jumping off a bridge. He walked to the middle of the bridge, climbed over the railing, stood on the tiny ledge on the edge of the bridge, and prepared to jump. A taxi driver who happened to be crossing the bridge at that moment saw what the stockbroker was doing. The taxi driver slammed on his brakes, jumped out of his taxi, started running toward the stockbroker, and yelled, \"Don't do it!\" Pleased to hear that someone cared about him, the stockbroker changed his mind about committing suicide and decided that he wanted to live. At that moment, however, the stockbroker started to lose his balance, and his feet began to slip off the small, grimy ledge of the bridge. Just as the stockbroker started to fall, the taxi driver reached him and grabbed the back of his jacket. The taxi driver hung on tightly to the jacket and nearly was pulled over the side of the bridge, but he managed to hang on. Using every bit of strength he could muster, the taxi driver pulled the stockbroker back up and onto the bridge. The stockbroker was relieved to have been saved from falling. Unfortunately, the taxi driver suffered a severe injury to his back from the strain of hanging on to the stockbroker and pulling him back up onto the bridge. A statute in the jurisdiction makes attempted suicide a crime. If the taxi driver asserts a claim against the stockbroker to recover damages for his injuries, will he prevail? Choices: I. No, because the stockbroker did not intend to harm anyone other than himself. or II. No, because attempted suicide was a criminal offense in the jurisdiction. or III.

In accordance with the new law, all beer consumed within the state must be sold in aluminum cans that are recyclable. There is a provision of the statute that does permit breweries to distribute beer to bars, taverns, and restaurants in kegs for \"on-site\" consumption by patrons. Before the passage of the law, approximately 28% of all beer consumed in the state was packaged in glass bottles. Of that total, 75% of the beer was bottled outside the state, while 25% was bottled by companies in-state. The legislature passed the law at the strong urging of the aluminum can industry. It was estimated that one aluminum company alone spent over $5,000,000 in its lobbying campaign for the passage of the bill. Ironically, the new law even received strong support from environmentalists who believed that recyclable cans would help prevent littering and unsightly trash accumulation. The strongest federal constitutional argument against the validity of the law is that it violates the Choices: I. equal protection clause of the Fourteenth Amendment by discriminating against beer bottlers. or II. privileges or immunities clause of the Fourteenth Amendment by preventing out-of-state beer bottlers from conducting their business in the state. or III. commerce clause by violating the negative implications on interstate commerce. or IV. contracts clause by impairing the ability of beer bottlers to honor existing contracts for the sale of bottled beer in the state.

In accordance with the new law, all beer consumed within the state must be sold in aluminum cans that are recyclable. There is a provision of the statute that does permit breweries to distribute beer to bars, taverns, and restaurants in kegs for \"on-site\" consumption by patrons. Before the passage of the law, approximately 28% of all beer consumed in the state was packaged in glass bottles. Of that total, 75% of the beer was bottled outside the state, while 25% was bottled by companies in-state. The legislature passed the law at the strong urging of the aluminum can industry. It was estimated that one aluminum company alone spent over $5,000,000 in its lobbying campaign for the passage of the bill. Ironically, the new law even received strong support from environmentalists who believed that recyclable cans would help prevent littering and unsightly trash accumulation.

The man's wife and his daughter died one year later in a motor vehicle accident.
