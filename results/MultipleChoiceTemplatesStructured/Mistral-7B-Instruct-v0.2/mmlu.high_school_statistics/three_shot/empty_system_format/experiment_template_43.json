Choices: I. If properly designed, either observational studies or controlled experiments can easily be used to establish cause and effect. II. While observational studies gather information on an already existing condition, they still often involve intentionally forcing some treatment to note the response. III. Stratifying in sampling is the same idea as blocking for experiments. IV. In an experiment, researchers decide on the treatment but typically allow the subjects to self-select into the control group.

One hundred cards are dealt from a well-shuffled pack, with each card being replaced after a deal. Using a 5 percent level of significance, what is the lowest number of cards that the subject needs to call out correctly in order to show that he is doing better than he would if he were simply guessing?

A confidence interval needs to be constructed for the slope of the regression line. The social worker in charge of the project is debating whether to use a 90 percent or a 95 percent confidence interval. Which of the following statements about the length of these intervals is true? Choices: I. The 95 percent confidence interval will be narrower than the 90 percent confidence interval. II. The length of the confidence interval will depend on the sample size, not on the confidence level. III. Both intervals will be of the same length, because they are computed from the same sample. IV. The 95 percent confidence interval will be wider than the 90 percent confidence interval. Answer:\nIV. The 95 percent confidence interval will be wider than the 90 percent confidence interval.\n\nQuestion: [question] Choices: [choices] Answer: [answer]\nQuestion: Suppose there is a correlation of r = 0.9 between number of hours per day students study and GPAs.

Each item has a chip somewhere inside. Upon checkout, the chip is deactivated so the scanner will not set off the alarm. The scanner has a 98% chance of detecting an active chip (meaning the material has not been checked out) and setting off the alarm. The scanner also has a 3% chance of sounding the alarm when someone passes through without an active chip. It is estimated that 0.5% of library customers actually try to leave the library with an active chip. What is the probability that, if the alarm sounds, the patron leaving the library has an item with an active chip?
