Over the year, she has become fluent in social English. After a few months in a monolingual English second grade, her teacher refers her for evaluation because she has great difficulty with the basal reader used in the class. Two English proficiency tests administered to the student show that she performs above the mean for monolingual English grade peers in speaking and listening but well below the mean in reading and writing.

Continued use of the student's native language in her home environment is interfering with her development of English. OR B. The student's reading difficulty is an early indicator that she will have increased academic problems as her coursework requires more reading. OR C.
