Establishing the session included checking the server certificate and executing a DiffieHelmann exchange, but the client did not provide a client certificate. Further, assume that the client and server are honest, that the client and server don\u2019t leak their keys, and that the cryptography is good.

What ensures that an expired Kerberos ticket can no longer be used? Choices: 1. The Kerberos server (KDC) refuses to establish new connections between clients and servers for expired tickets., 2. When a client connects to a server, the server sets a 24-hour timer to terminate the connection, which ensures a client cannot remain connected past the ticket\u2019s maximum lifetime., 3. When a client connects to a server, the server compares the ticket\u2019s expiration time to the server\u2019s current clock, and refuses to authenticate the user if the ticket expiration time is in the past., 4. When a client connects to a server, the server sends a query to the KDC to check if the ticket is still valid with respect to the KDC\u2019s clock, and refuses to authenticate the user if the KDC reports that the ticket is expired.

Ben Bitdiddle notes that NaCl uses Intel x86 segmentation to ensure that the sandboxed module does not read or write memory outside its own data area, and does not execute instructions outside its own code. Ben thinks that with these restrictions alone, executing the sandboxed module must be safe; that is, he thinks validation is not needed. Ben is wrong. Circle the types of x86 machine instructions that the validator always forbids in sandboxed code. Please ignore trampoline and springboard code.
