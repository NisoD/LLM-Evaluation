The user unlocks the phone and runs Innocent. Innocent exploits a bug in the iOS kernel which allows Innocent to redirect execution inside the kernel to code that Innocent controls. Now Innocent can execute any instructions it likes inside the iOS kernel. Innocent is not able to exploit any bugs in the phone\u2019s secure enclave. Can Innocent read the user\u2019s private information stored in the phone\u2019s flash (e.g. Contacts and messages), or will the security measures described in the paper keep the data private? If Innocent is only able to see encrypted data, then the phone has successfully kept the data private. Circle the security features of the phone (if any) that will prevent Innocent from reading information from the flash on the phone. Choices: 1. Secure boot chain; 2. The secure enclave\u2019s ephemeral key; 3. None of the above; 4. System software authorization  Answer:\n3. None of the above\n\nQuestion: [question] Choices: [choices] Answer: [answer]\nQuestion: The ______________ can cost you money, by sending text messages from your mobile phone numbers. Choices: 1.
