For instance, the addition function on reals has a signature of\nadd : real x real -> real\nsince it takes two real numbers and returns a real number. But, for a language that allows functions as return values, addition could be considered to have the signature\nadd : real -> (real -> real)\nwhich means that add takes a single real (the first operand) and returns a new function that itself takes a single real (the second operand) and returns a real (the result). This process of reducing a function with multiple arguments to a function with fewer arguments is called currying. Which of the following is correct? Choices: A. Currying can be applied to any function to the point where it has exactly one input argument. B. Currying cannot be applied to functions of more than two arguments. C. Currying cannot be applied to functions that return functions as arguments. D. Currying cannot be applied w functions that haw arguments that are functions. Answer:\n",

The time for an external analog-to-digital converter (which is triggered by a CPU instruction) to digitize one input is 12 microseconds, and only one digitization occurs at a time. Five CPU instructions, including the triggering instruction, must be executed for each signal digitized. Ten CPU instructions are executed in order to average each set of four samples and output this value. The time to convert the output from digital to analog form is to be ignored.
