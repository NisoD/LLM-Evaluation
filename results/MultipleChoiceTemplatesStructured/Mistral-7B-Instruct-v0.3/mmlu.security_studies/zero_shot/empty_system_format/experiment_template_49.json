Choices: I. The emergence of norms governing the response to address the spectre of organized crime and to harmonize legislation occurred with the evolving Global War on Terror in which the terrorism-organized crime nexus resulted in the militarization of law enforcement: the use of military technology and intelligence as opposed to addressing the underlying conditions that facilitate illicit trade through an international institutionalist response.; II. With the expansion of TNC in the 1990s, states became increasingly willing to take measures to reduce the asymmetries between countries through harmonization of legislation and increasing police capacity and networking. The government response to transnational crime has focused on targeting the individuals and organizations perpetrating the crime, rather than the criminal markets themselves.; III. The US war on drugs has heavily influenced the construction of the governmental response to the growing perception that the phenomenon of TNC represents a national security threat. The approach has an emphasis on bilateral and multilateral cooperation on law enforcement combined with sticks on a bi-lateral basis to induce states to increase regulation and enforcement against TNC.; IV. State responses to transnational crime have evolved in correlation to the increased threat posed to the integrity of the state. Organized crime has been regarded primarily as a national security threat to be addressed domestically.

The ecological security and human security approaches to environmental security do not challenge the security community to consider alternative objects of security. Ecological security displays continuity with major interpretations of security, which typically centralize the security of the state.; III.

Weak state insecurity in a historical framework of analysis represents an abnormal state in the long term state-building process. Bloody and violent conflict between social forces is not consistent with the presence of the centralizing force with the capacity to attain monopoly of control over violence.; III. Weak state insecurity originated from the denial of sovereignty as the norm and the corresponding extension of the right to inviolability of statehood.

Thus, IFIs adopted an approach that involved political and economic restructuring of these states, coercing governments into the adoption of specific financial policies designed to promote debt repayment and economic development.; II. Through the implementation of specific financial policies adopted at the bequest of global financial institutions, many developing countries have gained economic prosperity and the correlating levels of human security.; III. The World Bank and IMF tend to operate in an economic arena that includes only major financial institutions and wealthy states; coupled with a respect for sovereignty, the scope of such institutions does not reach to interference in national politics.; IV. Financial policies advocated by the World Bank and IMF were readily adopted by developing countries that sought to bring their economic development into line with wealthier nations.

Choices: I. All of these options.; II. Coalitional coercive diplomacy is the only credible means for Western democracies to gain the sincerity required to make a threat of force real in the mind of the adversary. However, past efforts of coalitional building have proved to be extremely limited. Disagreements over the means and coordination of the policy often result in splits and consequently states are reluctant to employ it. Where it has been employed it collapses under the weight of its own inadequacy.; III. Increased verification capabilities brought in with the technological and communication revolution have resulted in a practical difficulty for practitioners, enabling the verification of tactical/temporary and strategic/lasting - only the latter of which constituting a compliance success. The capacity to verify processes have highlighted instances of non-compliance following inconclusive coercive diplomacy exchanges.; IV. Different natures of the adversaries complicate the use of Western coercion. Their tendency to rely on irregular or asymmetric military strategies makes it hard to threaten or even defeat their opponent's military strategy. Those actors deny forces the ability to win quickly with little cost.

Choices: I. A central notion of critique is to provide an answer to the problem of what it means to be critical. This invariably raises the question of revealing the interest behind knowledge claims with the goal of social change, what is accepted as the end of theory: that the practical and contextual understandings inform to whom knowledge claims serve.; II. Central to the political and critical nature of post-structural literature is the idea of fostering an ethos of democracy and an ethos of critique which is finite and attainable. It is to this end that we must strive, but one that can only be met under the conditions prescribed, that of true democracy.; III. Poststructuralism accepts the form and foundations for knowledge claims that dominate the security studies debate. This has brought it into confrontation with the critical studies community, having little to contribute to the understanding of the ways in which knowledge is constructed.; IV. One of the founding assumptions of Critical Security Studies is that theories about the world constitute that world and thus that theory, including security theory, has political effects. The consequence is that theory is the product of the system, and that analyses of the agent of security and the referent object is produced by its own practices. Answer:\n", "Result": "\nI.

Post-structuralism provides no basis for political action, being a dangerous mix of faux radicalism, relativism and obscurantism, whilst constructivism is an orientation to world politics rather than a specific political theory.; III.
