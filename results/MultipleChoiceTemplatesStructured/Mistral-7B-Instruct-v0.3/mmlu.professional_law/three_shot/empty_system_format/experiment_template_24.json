Due to the precipitous drop in oil prices, many oil companies have been forced to cut back on oil production and lay off many workers. As a result, unemployment has reached all-time high levels in several states. In order to alleviate this potentially catastrophic situation, the one of those state's legislatures recently enacted a statute requiring that 10% of all oil produced within the state be purchased by the state and reserved for use by state residents. The purpose of the statute was twofold: (1) it was intended to stimulate the oil industry within the state by encouraging more production and exploration, and (2) it was designed to create an oil reserve so that state residents and industries would not suffer unduly from future oil shortages. Subsequently, Congress enacted a statute forbidding states to reserve local resources for local use in this manner. Is this state statute constitutional? Choices: a. Yes, because Congress has not expressly forbidden states to reserve local resources for local use.  OR b. Yes, because the state statute requires that the oil be used for the general welfare of the people in emergency situations.  OR c. No, because a state may not protect its residents from out-of-state competition for its natural resources without the express permission of Congress.  OR d. No, because application of the statute denies non-oil producing companies to equal protection of the law, in violation of the Fourteenth Amendment.  Answer:\nc.

The leader of the foreign country sought the assistance of the United States in providing emergency aid. The President initially wanted to send troops from a west coast military base but learned that they were out on training maneuvers. As a result, the President issued an executive order directing members of a federal agency under the supervision of the Immigration and Naturalization Service, to travel to the foreign country to engage in emergency rescue operations. This federal agency's main function is to patrol the borders to prevent illegal aliens from entering the United States. A member of this federal agency refused to comply with the executive order and assist in the relief effort.

He brought suit in federal court challenging the validity of the President's executive order. Assuming the member of the federal agency has adequate standing, the court should rule the executive order Choices: a. valid, because as commander-in-chief, the President has unfettered authority to require federal employees to participate in an international relief effort. OR b. valid, because employees of an executive agency can be required to perform such emergency functions.

The loan was secured by a mortgage on the building that housed the company's operation center. Eight months later, the company's sales started to drop and the company began experiencing cash flow problems. As a result, the company failed to make its loan payments for three consecutive months, causing the credit union to threaten to foreclose on the mortgage. The president's father, a retired wealthy investor, then intervened on behalf of the company, paid the three missed loan payments, and told the credit union that if they would refrain from any legal action against the company for a year, he would personally see that the debt was paid. The credit union orally agreed to the father's surety arrangement. However, it was never reduced to writing. Six months later, the company once again missed consecutive payments, and the credit union filed a foreclosure suit against the company.

The so-called installment land contract has been popular as a substitute for the mortgage or deed of trust. Under such a contract, the seller agrees to accept, and the buyer agrees to pay, the purchase price in installments over a stipulated period of time. The vendor retains legal title as security for the payment of the purchase price; and the vendee has equitable title under the doctrine of equitable conversion. The most important characteristic of the installment land contract, however, is the forfeiture clause, which provides that if the vendee is in default for 30 days, the vendor may, at his option, declare a forfeiture of the contract, in which case all payments made shall be forfeited as \"liquidated\" damages and the buyer shall become a tenant at will of the seller. Over the years, many sellers of property under such installment land contracts have declared forfeitures in situations where the prospective buyers were delinquent in their payments, even when the buyer was late with a single payment after nearly all the other payments had been made. In order to remedy this inequitable situation, the state legislature enacted a statute requiring any seller attempting to declare a forfeiture of an installment land contract to do so by instituting a formal foreclosure action in the courts. The new law also provided that prior to the commencement of such a foreclosure action, the seller under such an arrangement must give the buyer a 60-day grace period to make up any delinquent installment payment with interest. The new law expressly applied both to installment land contracts entered into subsequent to its enactment and to installment land contracts already in existence at the time of its enactment. Is this new state statute likely to be held constitutional? Choices: a. Yes, because it is a reasonable regulation of the procedure to be followed in such cases and does not substantially diminish the underlying obligations of the buyer. OR b. Yes, because the authority to enact laws regulating real estate sales transactions occurring within the boundaries of individual states is reserved exclusively to the states by the Tenth Amendment. OR c. No, because application of the law to installment land contracts entered into prior to its enactment is a violation of the obligation of contracts. OR d. No, because application of the law to installment land contracts entered into before or after its enactment is a deprivation of a proprietary interest without due process of the law.

Situated along the north shore of this island were coral reefs which are the home of a very rare species of fish that are found only along the north shore area. Congress conducted hearings to decide whether to authorize the construction of the naval base.

The homeowner called the store that sold the vacuum cleaner and arranged to return it for a refund. The homeowner was busy, however, and would not have time to make a trip to the store for several days; so he put the vacuum cleaner in a corner in his living room to store it until he had a chance to take it to the store. The next day, the homeowner had an old friend from out of town arrive for a three-day visit. The homeowner had a spare room and loved to have overnight guests, so he had invited this old friend to come for a visit and was excited to see her. Shortly after the guest's arrival, however, the homeowner had to go to work for a few hours, so he told his friend to make herself comfortable in the house while he went to his office. While the homeowner was away from the house, his friend got hungry and made herself a snack. After finishing the snack, she realized that she had dropped a lot of crumbs on the carpet. Wanting to be a polite guest, she decided to clean up the mess herself before the homeowner returned.

Several years later, at a time when the woman still owed the bank $750,000 on the mortgage loan, she sold the farm to a man for $900,000. The man paid the woman $150,000 in cash and specifically assumed the mortgage note. The bank received notice of this transaction and elected not to exer-cise the optional due-on-sale clause in the mortgage.

The home would house 200 beds for persons needing nursing home care for the remainder of their lives. The state government approved the request and certified the need for more nursing homes in that township.

The plant had been shut down for 10 years. Much to Darlene's chagrin, officials at the plant had announced plans to reopen the plant. Darlene, who was a waitress at a local restaurant, devised a scheme whereby she would contaminate oysters at her restaurant with small amounts of a poisonous substance. Although she didn't want to seriously injure anyone, Darlene believed that if some people got sick from eating the oysters, they would attribute their illness to nuclear waste from the power plant. To facilitate her plan, she stole some poison from a local pharmacy. She sprinkled it on some oysters at the restaurant where she worked. Mistakenly, she put too much of the poison on some of the oysters. A few of the customers who ate the oysters became sick and nauseated. One person suffered convulsions and died from the poisoning. A statute in the jurisdiction provides: \"Any intentional and premeditated killing, or one occurring during the perpetration of a felony, is murder in the first degree. Murder in the second degree is murder with intent to cause serious bodily harm. Manslaughter is an unlawful killing due to recklessness. \"Assault with intent to kill or to cause serious physical injury is a felony in the jurisdiction.

OR b. first-degree murder, because the death occurred during the commission of a felony.  OR c. second-degree murder, because of the intent to cause physical harm.

Congress cannot preempt state laws requiring a specified minimum level of requiring a specified minimum level of fuel efficiency for lawn mowers, because the use of such equipment is a wholly local event and, therefore, is beyond the regulatory authority vested in Congress by the commerce clause. OR b. The law is unaffected by the federal statute, because Congress did not expressly prohibit state laws requiring power equipment to meet specified levels of fuel efficiency. OR c. The purpose of the law is consistent with the purpose of the federal statute, enforcement of the law would not interfere with the full execution of the statute, and there is no evidence that Congress intended to preclude the states from enacting supplemental laws on this subject. OR d. There is a very strong presumption that a specific state law on a subject normally within the state's police power prevails over a more general federal statute, because the Tenth Amendment reserves to the states primary authority over matters affecting public health, welfare, and safety. Answer:\nc. The purpose of the law is consistent with the purpose of the federal statute, enforcement of the law would not interfere with the full execution of the statute, and there is no evidence that Congress intended to preclude the states from enacting supplemental laws on this subject.\n\nQuestion: [question] Choices: [choices] Answer: [answer]\nQuestion: A man was angry at a coworker who had received a promotion.

In 1994, the farmer delivered to his son, for a sum of $1,000, a deed signed by the farmer, naming the son and his heirs as grantee, and appearing valid on its face. The son neglected to record the deed. In 1998, an investor, aware of the existence of the farmer-to-son deed, sought out the farmer and asked to buy for $10,000 a deed of the farm from the farmer to the investor and his heirs. The farmer executed such a deed, and the investor promptly recorded it. The investor's intent was to acquire color of title and obtain ownership of the farm by adverse possession. In 1998, the investor constructed a fence around the farm. In 1999, the son presented his deed of the farm to a rancher and, for $15,000, paid by the rancher, signed and delivered a deed of the farm in favor of the rancher and his heirs. After receiving the deed, the rancher made no effort to search the title, to examine the property, or to record the deed. In 2003, a teacher paid the investor $20,000, and the investor delivered to the teacher a deed of the farm in favor of the teacher and his heirs. The teacher had examined the property, had searched the title, and was aware of the prior farmer-to-son instrument. Although the teacher did not reside on the property,he regularly visited the farm twice a week. The teacher recorded his deed. In 2007, for $25,000, paid by a professor, the rancher signed and delivered a deed of the farm naming the professor and his heirs as grantees.

The rental agreement provided that the land was to be used as farmland. Shortly after the tenant took possession of the tract of land, he built thereon, at his own expense, a barn made of lumber, which was 15 feet wide, 20 feet long, and set on loose bricks. The barn increased the appraised market value of the tract of land from $250,000 to $275,000. The tenant then began farming operations on the land. Toward the end of the lease period, the owner informed the tenant that he was going to put the tract of land up for sale. The next month, when the lease expired, the parties settled a dispute over the tenant's right, if any, to compensation for the improvements by the following written agreement:\"On the sale of the tract of land, the owner hereby agrees to pay the tenant two-thirds of any sale proceeds in excess of $250,000, provided that tenant may remain on the farm for the next year, rent-free, while the owner tries to sell it. After that time, the tenant may remain on the land until closing of the sale, at a monthly rental of $1,000. \"The owner initially set the asking price at $300,000. After receiving scant interest, the owner decided to reduce the price to $260,000. This price reduction so infuriated the tenant that he thereafter made negative comments about the farm to all of the prospective buyers. Finally, 14 months after the agreement between the owner and the tenant was executed, and after rejecting offers for $240,000 and $250,000, the owner sold the tract of land for $256,000 to a buyer who visited the land while the tenant was away on vacation. Thereupon, the tenant, who had failed to pay the last two months rent as per the agreement, moved out. After closing, the owner refused to pay the tenant any of the sale proceeds, and the tenant brought suit to recover damages for breach of contract. Which of the following is the owner's most persuasive argument in defense of the tenant's suit? Choices: a. The tenant committed an uncured material breach of an implied promise to cooperate in the owner's efforts to sell the property, or at least not to hinder the proposed sale. OR b. The tenant's negative comments about the farm to prospective buyers amounted to an anticipatory repudiation of the agreement between the owner and the tenant. OR c. The tenant's failure to pay any rent for the last two months was a material breach of contract that discharged the owner's remaining duties of performance. OR d.

He sued the manufacturer in federal court. At trial, the defendants filed a motion to preclude the report and testimony of the plaintiff's expert under Fed.R.Evid. 702. The defendants claim bias, lack of scientific support, failure to conduct testing, divergence of opinion among experts, and that the expert was trained for large commercial fires. The expert had investigated over 500 fires, wrote a book that was used in courses nationwide and taught a course in forensic fire investigations in a university. Her report ruled out all other possible causes. The court did a gate-keeping review as required by Rule 702 and ruled that the expert was highly qualified and that she used accepted scientific methodologies in arriving at her opinion. The defendants appealed the ruling. Is the appellate court likely to go against the ruling under these facts? Choices: a. Yes, because the charge of bias against an expert witness requires a \"trial within a trial\" and that was not done. OR b. Yes, because whenever the expert does not back up her conclusion with experimental testing, an expert's opinion will be insufficiently reliable to be allowed. OR c. No, the court did the required gate-keeping inquiry and found that the witness was not only qualified and competent, but also used the accepted methodologies. OR d.

The tenant established a hardware store on the first floor and equipped the second floor as an apartment in which he lived with his wife and children. The two floors were connected by an outside wooden staircase with a handrail. The staircase was in a dilapidated condition at the time the tenant entered into the leasehold agreement.

The statute authorized pari-mutuel betting at certain track locations within the state. A seven-member commission was established and empowered to supervise and regulate the sport's activities. Under an inseparable provision of the statute, the commission was authorized to suspend the racing license of any trainer whose horse tested positive for illegal drugs. The statute permitted the commission to make the suspension without any prior hearing. However, suspended trainers were entitled to a prompt post- suspension hearing and decision on any issues in dispute. The racing season was inaugurated at the largest racetrack in the state. The featured race was a $1,000,000 harness race for 2-year-old trotters. After the awards presentation, the winning horse underwent a standard drug test and traces of cocaine were found in his urine sample. Immediately thereafter, the horse was disqualified and the commission suspended the horse's trainer, without a prior hearing. Without seeking a post-suspension hearing as provided by statute, the trainer brings suit in federal district court challenging the constitutionality of the state harness racing law. The statute is probably Choices: a. constitutional, because being granted a racing license is a privilege, not a right.  OR b. constitutional, because the state's interest in suspending the license of horse trainers suspected of illegal drugging is sufficiently important to permit the suspension of any prior hearing.  OR c. unconstitutional, because the suspension provision unreasonably interferes with a trainer's right to contract with horse owners and seek gainful employment.  OR d. unconstitutional, because the suspension provision violates due process by not affording a prior hearing.

It authorizes the president of either country to issue a proclamation nullifying any state or local laws in that country that have the effect of impeding imports from the other country. The foreign country uses the metric system of measurement, and thus all goods produced there and exported to the United States are packaged in metric sizes, such as liters and kilograms. A law of a state in the United States requires all goods sold in that state to be packaged in traditional American sizes, such as quarts or pounds.

When the seller told her that he had sold the land to a third party, she sued him for breach of the written contract. For whom will the court find?  Choices: a. For the buyer, because she informed the seller within a reasonable time that she desired to close the transaction. OR b. For the buyer, because the agreement to rescind the contract was not in a writing signed by the buyer and the seller. OR c. For the seller, because the contract failed to contain a stated closing date. OR d. For the seller, because the oral rescission was valid. Answer:\nb.

The statute does not expressly preempt state law. Assume that no other federal statute or administrative regulation addresses the energy efficiency of power equipment. Which of the following is the best argument the state can make for the continued validity of its law?  Choices: a. Congress cannot preempt state laws requiring a specified minimum level of requiring a specified minimum level of fuel efficiency for lawn mowers, because the use of such equipment is a wholly local event and, therefore, is beyond the regulatory authority vested in Congress by the commerce clause.

The homeowner received notice that her uncle had passed away and left her a two-story mansion in a neighboring city. The homeowner decided to move her primary residence to the mansion and rent the ranch-style home. She entered into a one- year written lease agreement with a tenant. The agreement set the monthly rent at $1,000. Shortly after the tenant took possession of the home, he built, at his own expense, a room addition onto the home. The room addition increased the appraised market value of the home from $200,000 to $250,000. At the expiration of the lease, the homeowner informed the tenant that she had decided to sell the home. She offered the tenant the first opportunity to buy the home, but the tenant replied that he could not afford to do so. The tenant did claim that he should be entitled to compensation for the room addition, since it had increased the value of the home, and the homeowner agreed. The tenant and the homeowner then executed the following agreement:\"On the sale of the ranch-style home, the homeowner hereby promises to pay the tenant one- half of any sale proceeds in excess of $200,000, in compensation of the tenant's efforts in constructing the room addition onto the home. In addition, it is hereby agreed that the tenant may remain on the land until the sale is finalized, at a monthly rent of$500. ,'The homeowner initially set the asking price at $250,000, but received no offers to purchase the home. The homeowner decided to reduce the price to $210,000. This price reduction so infuriated the tenant that he thereafter made negative comments about the home to all of the prospective buyers who visited the home. Two months later, the homeowner sold the home to a buyer for $206,000. The buyer had visited the home while the tenant was away on a business trip and therefore did not hear the tenant's negative comments. Thereupon, the tenant, who had paid no rent for the final two months, moved out. After the sale was finalized, the homeowner refused to pay the tenant any of the sale proceeds. Which of the following statements, if true, most persuasively supports the tenant's contention that he is entitled to recover at least $4,000 from the owner (or the equivalent of one-half of the sale proceeds in excess of $200,000, minus two months' unpaid rent at $500 per month)? Choices: a. The owner breached an implied promise by failing to attempt to sell the property at $250,000, which was the appraised market value of the home.  OR b. Since the tenant made no negative comments about the home to the buyer, there is no showing that the tenant's remarks to the other prospective buyers necessarily caused any loss to the owner (i. e. , prevented her from selling the home for more than $210,000).  OR c. The agreement between the homeowner that the tenant contained only one express condition (i. e. , the tenant was permitted to remain in the home during the owner's efforts to sell it), and since that condition has occurred, the tenant is entitled to his share of the proceeds from the sale.  OR d. Even if the tenant's failure to pay any rent for the last two months was a material breach of contract, the owner's promise to pay the tenant a share of the proceeds of the sale was an independent covenant.

Due to the precipitous drop in oil prices, many oil companies have been forced to cut back on oil production and lay off many workers. As a result, unemployment has reached all-time high levels in several states. In order to alleviate this potentially catastrophic situation, the one of those state's legislatures recently enacted a statute requiring that 10% of all oil produced within the state be purchased by the state and reserved for use by state residents. The purpose of the statute was twofold: (1) it was intended to stimulate the oil industry within the state by encouraging more production and exploration, and (2) it was designed to create an oil reserve so that state residents and industries would not suffer unduly from future oil shortages. Subsequently, Congress enacted a statute forbidding states to reserve local resources for local use in this manner. Is this state statute constitutional? Choices: a. Yes, because Congress has not expressly forbidden states to reserve local resources for local use.  OR b. Yes, because the state statute requires that the oil be used for the general welfare of the people in emergency situations.  OR c.

Several years later, at a time when the woman still owed the bank $750,000 on the mortgage loan, she sold the farm to a man for $900,000. The man paid the woman $150,000 in cash and specifically assumed the mortgage note. The bank received notice of this transaction and elected not to exer-cise the optional due-on-sale clause in the mortgage. Without informing the man, the bank later released the woman from any further personal liability on the note. After he had owned the farm for a number of years, the man defaulted on the loan. The bank properly accelerated the loan, and the farm was eventually sold at a foreclosure sale for $500,000. Because there was still $600,000 owing on the note, the bank sued the man for the $100,000 deficiency. Is the man liable to the bank for the deficiency? Choices: a. No, because the woman would have still been primarily liable for payment, but the bank had released her from personal liability. OR b.

The loan was secured by a mortgage on the building that housed the company's operation center. Eight months later, the company's sales started to drop and the company began experiencing cash flow problems. As a result, the company failed to make its loan payments for three consecutive months, causing the credit union to threaten to foreclose on the mortgage. The president's father, a retired wealthy investor, then intervened on behalf of the company, paid the three missed loan payments, and told the credit union that if they would refrain from any legal action against the company for a year, he would personally see that the debt was paid. The credit union orally agreed to the father's surety arrangement. However, it was never reduced to writing. Six months later, the company once again missed consecutive payments, and the credit union filed a foreclosure suit against the company.

The man was convicted of selling large quantities of an illegal drug from his house. Acting under a state law authorizing the destruction of buildings that are used for illegal activity, the city destroyed the man\u00d5s house. The man\u00d5s family then rented an apartment and demanded that the city pay the rent for that temporary residence. The family relied on a state law providing that any person who was dispossessed of his or her place of residence because of the actions of city officials was entitled to replacement housing at the city\u00d5s expense until permanent substitute housing could be found. When the city refused to pay the rent for the apartment, the man\u00d5s family sued the city in a state trial court claiming a right to such payment under both the state law and the due process clause of the Fourteenth Amendment to the United States Constitution. The highest state court ruled for the family. Although the court decided that the family had no right to payment under the state law, it held that the Fourteenth Amendment entitled the family to payment of the rent for the temporary apart-ment. In its opinion, the highest state court indicated that in several of its decisions it had found cities liable for compen-sation in similar situations on the basis of the due process clause of the state constitution. But the highest state court declined to base its holding on the state constitution because that issue had not been properly raised in the case. The city then filed a petition for a writ of certiorari in the United States Supreme Court. Does the Court have jurisdiction to review the merits of this case? Choices: a. Yes, because the highest state court based its decision wholly on federal law grounds. OR b. Yes, because the federal and state law issues in this case are so intertwined that a resolution of the federal law issues is necessary to facilitate a proper determination of the state law issues. OR c. No, because the decision of the highest state court ren-ders the case moot. OR d. No, because independent state law grounds could have been used to justify the result in this case. Answer:\na.

They had been employed by the casino for four years. One day, they were unexpectedly fired by the casino's new manager. Apparently, the casino hired the new manager to get rid of some of the old-time employees and replace them with new personnel at a lower wage. Angered by their firing, the codefendants vowed to get back at the casino. As their revenge, they decided to plant a bomb in the casino and demand $1,000,000. After receiving the money, they would then reveal the location of the bomb and provide details for defusing it. The co-defendants agreed that the casino should be given adequate warning so that nobody would be injured. In accordance with their plan, one of the co-defendants, who was an electronics expert, built the bomb himself. He alone then drove to the casino where he placed the bomb in a hallway closet. Shortly thereafter, the other co-defendant phoned the casino and made a demand for the money. He said a bomb was in the casino and that it would explode in 24 hours unless the money was paid. The casino treated their demand as a crank call and refused to make any payment. With their plans having gone awry, the codefendants agreed that one of them should return to the casino and defuse the bomb. As one of the co-defendants was driving back to the casino, the bomb exploded, killing 30 people. A subsequent investigation revealed that a faulty wire caused the bomb to detonate prematurely. A state statute provides that detonating or attempting to detonate a bomb or explosive device in or near a building or dwelling is a felony. If the co-defendants are charged with violating the aforementioned statute, which of the following statements is correct? Choices: a.

The statute authorized pari-mutuel betting at certain track locations within the state. A seven-member commission was established and empowered to supervise and regulate the sport's activities. Under an inseparable provision of the statute, the commission was authorized to suspend the racing license of any trainer whose horse tested positive for illegal drugs. The statute permitted the commission to make the suspension without any prior hearing. However, suspended trainers were entitled to a prompt post- suspension hearing and decision on any issues in dispute. The racing season was inaugurated at the largest racetrack in the state. The featured race was a $1,000,000 harness race for 2-year-old trotters. After the awards presentation, the winning horse underwent a standard drug test and traces of cocaine were found in his urine sample. Immediately thereafter, the horse was disqualified and the commission suspended the horse's trainer, without a prior hearing. Without seeking a post-suspension hearing as provided by statute, the trainer brings suit in federal district court challenging the constitutionality of the state harness racing law. The statute is probably Choices: a. constitutional, because being granted a racing license is a privilege, not a right.  OR b. constitutional, because the state's interest in suspending the license of horse trainers suspected of illegal drugging is sufficiently important to permit the suspension of any prior hearing.  OR c. unconstitutional, because the suspension provision unreasonably interferes with a trainer's right to contract with horse owners and seek gainful employment.  OR d. unconstitutional, because the suspension provision violates due process by not affording a prior hearing.

The statute authorized pari-mutuel betting at certain track locations within the state. A seven-member commission was established and empowered to supervise and regulate the sport's activities. Under an inseparable provision of the statute, the commission was authorized to suspend the racing license of any trainer whose horse tested positive for illegal drugs. The statute permitted the commission to make the suspension without any prior hearing. However, suspended trainers were entitled to a prompt post- suspension hearing and decision on any issues in dispute. The racing season was inaugurated at the largest racetrack in the state. The featured race was a $1,000,000 harness race for 2-year-old trotters. After the awards presentation, the winning horse underwent a standard drug test and traces of cocaine were found in his urine sample. Immediately thereafter, the horse was disqualified and the commission suspended the horse's trainer, without a prior hearing. Without seeking a post-suspension hearing as provided by statute, the trainer brings suit in federal district court challenging the constitutionality of the state harness racing law. The statute is probably Choices: a. constitutional, because being granted a racing license is a privilege, not a right.  OR b. constitutional, because the state's interest in suspending the license of horse trainers suspected of illegal drugging is sufficiently important to permit the suspension of any prior hearing.  OR c. unconstitutional, because the suspension provision unreasonably interferes with a trainer's right to contract with horse owners and seek gainful employment.  OR d. unconstitutional, because the suspension provision violates due process by not affording a prior hearing.

Following their arrest, they were both taken to the police station and given Miranda warnings. They both expressed a desire to remain silent until they could consult an attorney. At the station house, they were booked and placed in separate jail cells. Later that day, and before any attorney consultations could take place, a police detective went to the coconspirator's cell and began interrogating him. The detective told the co-conspirator that if he cooperated in their investigation, the prosecuting attorney would drop charges against him. The co-conspirator then reluctantly confessed and implicated the defendant in the commission of the crimes. The co-conspirator also told the police where the defendant had hidden the stolen property.

The spa also provided health club facilities, such as saunas, steam rooms, and whirlpool baths. A 75-year-old spinster resided across the street from the spa. The spinster opposed the opening of the spa because she believed that it was a \"cover\" for an illegal operation.

On the evening of June 29, the spinster, disguising her voice, called the spa and told the businessman, \"You pimp, why don't you take your dirty trade elsewhere?\" Without paying any attention to the call, the businessman hung up.

The plant had been shut down for 10 years. Much to Darlene's chagrin, officials at the plant had announced plans to reopen the plant. Darlene, who was a waitress at a local restaurant, devised a scheme whereby she would contaminate oysters at her restaurant with small amounts of a poisonous substance. Although she didn't want to seriously injure anyone, Darlene believed that if some people got sick from eating the oysters, they would attribute their illness to nuclear waste from the power plant. To facilitate her plan, she stole some poison from a local pharmacy. She sprinkled it on some oysters at the restaurant where she worked. Mistakenly, she put too much of the poison on some of the oysters. A few of the customers who ate the oysters became sick and nauseated. One person suffered convulsions and died from the poisoning. A statute in the jurisdiction provides: \"Any intentional and premeditated killing, or one occurring during the perpetration of a felony, is murder in the first degree. Murder in the second degree is murder with intent to cause serious bodily harm. Manslaughter is an unlawful killing due to recklessness. \"Assault with intent to kill or to cause serious physical injury is a felony in the jurisdiction. There are no separate felonies relating to adulterating food or poisoning. The most serious crime for which Darlene can properly be convicted is Choices: a. first-degree murder, because her acts were intentional and premeditated.  OR b. first-degree murder, because the death occurred during the commission of a felony.  OR c. second-degree murder, because of the intent to cause physical harm.

The man was convicted of selling large quantities of an illegal drug from his house. Acting under a state law authorizing the destruction of buildings that are used for illegal activity, the city destroyed the man\u00d5s house. The man\u00d5s family then rented an apartment and demanded that the city pay the rent for that temporary residence. The family relied on a state law providing that any person who was dispossessed of his or her place of residence because of the actions of city officials was entitled to replacement housing at the city\u00d5s expense until permanent substitute housing could be found. When the city refused to pay the rent for the apartment, the man\u00d5s family sued the city in a state trial court claiming a right to such payment under both the state law and the due process clause of the Fourteenth Amendment to the United States Constitution. The highest state court ruled for the family. Although the court decided that the family had no right to payment under the state law, it held that the Fourteenth Amendment entitled the family to payment of the rent for the temporary apart-ment. In its opinion, the highest state court indicated that in several of its decisions it had found cities liable for compen-sation in similar situations on the basis of the due process clause of the state constitution. But the highest state court declined to base its holding on the state constitution because that issue had not been properly raised in the case. The city then filed a petition for a writ of certiorari in the United States Supreme Court. Does the Court have jurisdiction to review the merits of this case? Choices: a. Yes, because the highest state court based its decision wholly on federal law grounds. OR b.

The written contract entered included a \"production fee clause\" that provided that the production company would be \"paid $100,000 for the filming and editing of ten 30-second commercials\" that would be suitable for the candidate's television campaign broadcasts. The production fee clause also stipulated that the $100,000 would be paid to the production company \"on condition that the filming and editing be directed under the personal supervision of the president of the production company. \" The contract made no other reference to compensation. Thereafter, the production company filmed and edited the ten campaign commercials, which the candidate approved.

According to the bifurcated trial system, whenever a defendant pleads not guilty to an offense by reason of insanity, two trials will be held. The first one will simply determine whether the defendant has committed the offense for which she is charged. This trial will not address the issue of insanity. In the event that it is found that the defendant has, in fact, committed the offense, then a second trial will be conducted to determine whether she should be exculpated for the criminal action by reason of insanity. A woman was arrested and charged with murder. She pleaded not guilty by reason of insanity. At her first trial, the state introduced evidence showing that the woman was having an affair with the victim. When the victim tried to break off their relationship, the woman shot and killed him during a lover's quarrel. The woman was then called to testify in her own behalf. She testified that she had been living with the victim for two years prior to the time of his death. During that period she had undergone psychiatric treatment and was diagnosed as being schizophrenic. She further testified that at the time the victim was killed, she was under the influence of narcotics. While she was hallucinating, she remembered perceiving the victim as a demon and shot at this satanic figure in order to free herself from his evil spell. She then testified that she didn't believe shooting the demon was morally wrong. The prosecuting attorney objected to the woman's testimony. Over such objections, the trial judge admitted the woman's testimony. Was the trial judge correct in admitting the woman's testimony? Choices: a. No, because proof of mental disease requires the use of expert testimony. OR b. No, because testimony relating to her belief that she didn't know what she was doing was wrong, is not relevant until the second trial. OR c.

Several years later, at a time when the woman still owed the bank $750,000 on the mortgage loan, she sold the farm to a man for $900,000. The man paid the woman $150,000 in cash and specifically assumed the mortgage note.

Following their arrest, they were both taken to the police station and given Miranda warnings. They both expressed a desire to remain silent until they could consult an attorney. At the station house, they were booked and placed in separate jail cells. Later that day, and before any attorney consultations could take place, a police detective went to the coconspirator's cell and began interrogating him. The detective told the co-conspirator that if he cooperated in their investigation, the prosecuting attorney would drop charges against him. The co-conspirator then reluctantly confessed and implicated the defendant in the commission of the crimes. The co-conspirator also told the police where the defendant had hidden the stolen property. Based on this information, the police retrieved the stolen property, which included a diamond necklace. Later the same day, the police went to the defendant's jail cell and showed him the diamond necklace that they had recovered. They also told the defendant that the co-conspirator had confessed and implicated him in the perpetration of the crime. Confronted by this evidence, the defendant confessed.

The homeowner received notice that her uncle had passed away and left her a two-story mansion in a neighboring city. The homeowner decided to move her primary residence to the mansion and rent the ranch-style home. She entered into a one- year written lease agreement with a tenant. The agreement set the monthly rent at $1,000. Shortly after the tenant took possession of the home, he built, at his own expense, a room addition onto the home. The room addition increased the appraised market value of the home from $200,000 to $250,000. At the expiration of the lease, the homeowner informed the tenant that she had decided to sell the home. She offered the tenant the first opportunity to buy the home, but the tenant replied that he could not afford to do so. The tenant did claim that he should be entitled to compensation for the room addition, since it had increased the value of the home, and the homeowner agreed. The tenant and the homeowner then executed the following agreement:\"On the sale of the ranch-style home, the homeowner hereby promises to pay the tenant one- half of any sale proceeds in excess of $200,000, in compensation of the tenant's efforts in constructing the room addition onto the home. In addition, it is hereby agreed that the tenant may remain on the land until the sale is finalized, at a monthly rent of$500. ,'The homeowner initially set the asking price at $250,000, but received no offers to purchase the home. The homeowner decided to reduce the price to $210,000. This price reduction so infuriated the tenant that he thereafter made negative comments about the home to all of the prospective buyers who visited the home. Two months later, the homeowner sold the home to a buyer for $206,000. The buyer had visited the home while the tenant was away on a business trip and therefore did not hear the tenant's negative comments. Thereupon, the tenant, who had paid no rent for the final two months, moved out. After the sale was finalized, the homeowner refused to pay the tenant any of the sale proceeds. Which of the following statements, if true, most persuasively supports the tenant's contention that he is entitled to recover at least $4,000 from the owner (or the equivalent of one-half of the sale proceeds in excess of $200,000, minus two months' unpaid rent at $500 per month)? Choices: a. The owner breached an implied promise by failing to attempt to sell the property at $250,000, which was the appraised market value of the home.  OR b. Since the tenant made no negative comments about the home to the buyer, there is no showing that the tenant's remarks to the other prospective buyers necessarily caused any loss to the owner (i. e. , prevented her from selling the home for more than $210,000).  OR c. The agreement between the homeowner that the tenant contained only one express condition (i. e. , the tenant was permitted to remain in the home during the owner's efforts to sell it), and since that condition has occurred, the tenant is entitled to his share of the proceeds from the sale.  OR d. Even if the tenant's failure to pay any rent for the last two months was a material breach of contract, the owner's promise to pay the tenant a share of the proceeds of the sale was an independent covenant.  Answer:\nb. Since the tenant made no negative comments about the home to the buyer, there is no showing that the tenant's remarks to the other prospective buyers necessarily caused any loss to the owner (i. e. , prevented her from selling the home for more than $210,000). \n\nQuestion: [question] Choices: [choices] Answer: [answer]\nQuestion: On September 1, a buyer contracted to buy 1000 widgets from a seller at $10 per widget, delivery to take place on or before September 15.

Due to the precipitous drop in oil prices, many oil companies have been forced to cut back on oil production and lay off many workers. As a result, unemployment has reached all-time high levels in several states. In order to alleviate this potentially catastrophic situation, the one of those state's legislatures recently enacted a statute requiring that 10% of all oil produced within the state be purchased by the state and reserved for use by state residents. The purpose of the statute was twofold: (1) it was intended to stimulate the oil industry within the state by encouraging more production and exploration, and (2) it was designed to create an oil reserve so that state residents and industries would not suffer unduly from future oil shortages.

Some years prior to her death, she conveyed a deed in fee simple to her oldest son. After her death, her youngest son filed a claim against the estate contending that the father's will devised only a life estate to his wife. A state statute said that a fee simple would be presumed where the intent of the testator did not clearly show an intent to devise a lesser estate. The lower court held that the widow had received a defeasible fee conditioned on her remaining a widow.

Will the appellate court likely reverse the lower court's decision and rule that the oldest son did not receive full title to the property? Choices: a. Yes, because it was a life estate that ends on her remarriage or death, with a remainder over to all of the sons. OR b.

While on the trip, the outdoorsman went deer hunting. He was in a very desolate area, surrounded by a densely wooded terrain, that was located at least 100 miles from any habitation. After a rather uneventful morning with nothing at which to shoot, the outdoorsman suddenly spotted a bald eagle; a nearly extinct bird.

The woman's complaint included a lengthy description of what the supervisor had said and done over the years, quoting his telephone calls and emails to her and her own emails to the supervisor's manager asking for help. The employer moved for summary judgment, alleging that the woman was a pathological liar who had filed the action and included fictitious documents in revenge for having been fired. Because the woman's attorney was at a lengthy out-of-state trial when the summary-judgment motion was filed, he failed to respond to it.

Some years prior to her death, she conveyed a deed in fee simple to her oldest son. After her death, her youngest son filed a claim against the estate contending that the father's will devised only a life estate to his wife. A state statute said that a fee simple would be presumed where the intent of the testator did not clearly show an intent to devise a lesser estate. The lower court held that the widow had received a defeasible fee conditioned on her remaining a widow.

Will the appellate court likely reverse the lower court's decision and rule that the oldest son did not receive full title to the property? Choices: a. Yes, because it was a life estate that ends on her remarriage or death, with a remainder over to all of the sons. OR b. Yes, the deed could not convey more than a life estate because of the condition in the will. OR c.

The tenant established a hardware store on the first floor and equipped the second floor as an apartment in which he lived with his wife and children. The two floors were connected by an outside wooden staircase with a handrail. The staircase was in a dilapidated condition at the time the tenant entered into the leasehold agreement. When the tenant took possession of the building, he notified the owner about the condition of the staircase and insisted that it be repaired. Although the owner orally promised the tenant that he would remedy the condition, he failed to do so. Later that evening, the tenant and his wife were receiving some friends for a small dinner party. One of the guests arrived at 7:00 p. m. and climbed the stairs to the second floor apartment. When the guest was half way up the stairway, which had not been repaired, it collapsed, seriously injuring her. In a negligence action initiated by the guest to recover for injuries suffered as a result of her fall, she will most likely Choices: a. recover against the tenant only, because as a general rule, a lessor of land is not liable to his lessee or to others on the land for physical harm caused by any dangerous condition that existed when the lessee took possession.

A police officer who was standing in front of the shop rushed after the defendant and arrested him. The defendant, an indigent, was charged with grand larceny, a felony carrying the maximum penalty of seven months imprisonment and a S 1,000 fine. At his arraignment, the judge advised the defendant of his right to have counsel appointed for him. The defendant, however, told the judge that he wanted to represent himself and waive his right to a jury trial. The judge then questioned the defendant at length about his demands. The defendant indicated that he had no previous legal experience. He told the judge that the reason he didn't want a court-appointed attorney to represent him was because he didn't trust lawyers. The judge did not find the defendant's reasons for representing himself to be persuasive and appointed an attorney to represent him.

Some years prior to her death, she conveyed a deed in fee simple to her oldest son. After her death, her youngest son filed a claim against the estate contending that the father's will devised only a life estate to his wife. A state statute said that a fee simple would be presumed where the intent of the testator did not clearly show an intent to devise a lesser estate. The lower court held that the widow had received a defeasible fee conditioned on her remaining a widow. Because she did not marry, the deed to the son ripened into an indefeasible fee absolute at the time of conveyance. The younger son appealed. Will the appellate court likely reverse the lower court's decision and rule that the oldest son did not receive full title to the property? Choices: a. Yes, because it was a life estate that ends on her remarriage or death, with a remainder over to all of the sons. OR b. Yes, the deed could not convey more than a life estate because of the condition in the will. OR c. No, because the will devises a fee simple that was defeasible if she had remarried; the title and the deed ripened into an indefeasible fee simple when she conveyed the property. OR d. No, the deed superseded anything that was stated in the will because she was still alive when she conveyed title to her oldest son. Answer:\nc.

The tenant did claim that he should be entitled to compensation for the room addition, since it had increased the value of the home, and the homeowner agreed. The tenant and the homeowner then executed the following agreement:\"On the sale of the ranch-style home, the homeowner hereby promises to pay the tenant one- half of any sale proceeds in excess of $200,000, in compensation of the tenant's efforts in constructing the room addition onto the home. In addition, it is hereby agreed that the tenant may remain on the land until the sale is finalized, at a monthly rent of$500. ,'The homeowner initially set the asking price at $250,000, but received no offers to purchase the home. The homeowner decided to reduce the price to $210,000. This price reduction so infuriated the tenant that he thereafter made negative comments about the home to all of the prospective buyers who visited the home. Two months later, the homeowner sold the home to a buyer for $206,000. The buyer had visited the home while the tenant was away on a business trip and therefore did not hear the tenant's negative comments. Thereupon, the tenant, who had paid no rent for the final two months, moved out. After the sale was finalized, the homeowner refused to pay the tenant any of the sale proceeds. Which of the following statements, if true, most persuasively supports the tenant's contention that he is entitled to recover at least $4,000 from the owner (or the equivalent of one-half of the sale proceeds in excess of $200,000, minus two months' unpaid rent at $500 per month)? Choices: a. The owner breached an implied promise by failing to attempt to sell the property at $250,000, which was the appraised market value of the home.  OR b. Since the tenant made no negative comments about the home to the buyer, there is no showing that the tenant's remarks to the other prospective buyers necessarily caused any loss to the owner (i. e. , prevented her from selling the home for more than $210,000).  OR c. The agreement between the homeowner that the tenant contained only one express condition (i. e. , the tenant was permitted to remain in the home during the owner's efforts to sell it), and since that condition has occurred, the tenant is entitled to his share of the proceeds from the sale.  OR d. Even if the tenant's failure to pay any rent for the last two months was a material breach of contract, the owner's promise to pay the tenant a share of the proceeds of the sale was an independent covenant.  Answer:\nb. Since the tenant made no negative comments about the home to the buyer, there is no showing that the tenant's remarks to the other prospective buyers necessarily caused any loss to the owner (i. e. , prevented her from selling the home for more than $210,000). \n\nQuestion: [question] Choices: [choices] Answer: [answer]\nQuestion: A father lived with his son, who was addicted to crack cocaine.

In accordance with the new law, all beer consumed within the state must be sold in aluminum cans that are recyclable. There is a provision of the statute that does permit breweries to distribute beer to bars, taverns, and restaurants in kegs for \"on-site\" consumption by patrons. Before the passage of the law, approximately 28% of all beer consumed in the state was packaged in glass bottles. Of that total, 75% of the beer was bottled outside the state, while 25% was bottled by companies in-state. The legislature passed the law at the strong urging of the aluminum can industry.

The statute authorized pari-mutuel betting at certain track locations within the state. A seven-member commission was established and empowered to supervise and regulate the sport's activities. Under an inseparable provision of the statute, the commission was authorized to suspend the racing license of any trainer whose horse tested positive for illegal drugs. The statute permitted the commission to make the suspension without any prior hearing. However, suspended trainers were entitled to a prompt post- suspension hearing and decision on any issues in dispute. The racing season was inaugurated at the largest racetrack in the state. The featured race was a $1,000,000 harness race for 2-year-old trotters. After the awards presentation, the winning horse underwent a standard drug test and traces of cocaine were found in his urine sample. Immediately thereafter, the horse was disqualified and the commission suspended the horse's trainer, without a prior hearing. Without seeking a post-suspension hearing as provided by statute, the trainer brings suit in federal district court challenging the constitutionality of the state harness racing law. The statute is probably Choices: a. constitutional, because being granted a racing license is a privilege, not a right.  OR b. constitutional, because the state's interest in suspending the license of horse trainers suspected of illegal drugging is sufficiently important to permit the suspension of any prior hearing.  OR c. unconstitutional, because the suspension provision unreasonably interferes with a trainer's right to contract with horse owners and seek gainful employment.  OR d. unconstitutional, because the suspension provision violates due process by not affording a prior hearing.

After this agreement between Ann and Bea was signed and executed, Ann promptly returned the golf clubs to Bea. For the next six months, Bea made and Ann accepted the $400 monthly payments as agreed. During that period, Ann, in fact, did forbear to take any legal action against Carla. However, Bea then repudiated her agreement with Ann, and 30 days later Ann filed a contract action against Bea. Assume that the applicable statute of limitations on Ann's antecedent claim against Carla expired the day before Ann filed her contract action against Bea. Which of the following is the most persuasive argument that Bea is not liable to Ann under the terms of their written agreement? Choices: a. Since Ann did not expressly promise to forbear to sue Carla to collect the antecedent $4,000 debt, Ann's forbearance for six months could not constitute consideration for Bea's promise. OR b. Since the written agreement between Bea and Ann shows a gross imbalance between the values of the promises exchanged, the consideration for Bea's promise was legally insufficient to support it. OR c. Since Carla, when the agreement between Ann and Bea was made, had a pre-existing duty to repay the $4,000 debt to Ann, there was no consideration for Bea's promise to Ann. OR d.

He uses a candle to meditate when he is stressed on the job, which then calms him down. He has been mulling an idea in his mind to take a lot of money from his employer using his computer skills, and he has worked out a general plan in his mind. Once he obtains the money, he thinks it might be good to let a candle drop and have the whole building burn down. While he is out at lunch, the janitorial staff came through his office. While cleaning the area, one person lit a candle on the man's desk. When they left, he forgot to blow it out. They slammed the door on the way out, causing the lit candle to fall. It started a fire that burned the building down. What crime, if any, is the man most likely to be convicted of? Choices: a. Attempted arson, because he took steps to have a candle there to finish the criminal act, but someone else ended up causing an accidental fire that he did not cause. OR b. Arson, because he took a substantial act by having the candle on his desk, and the crime was finished by the foreseeable act of a janitor lighting it and causing a fire. OR c. Attempted arson and attempted murder. Attempted arson because he took a substantial step to committing arson. OR d. No crime, because he only had ideas in his mind and leaving the candle on his desk where he used it for meditation cannot be a substantial act toward committing a crime. Answer:\nd.

A new federal statute requires all power equipment, including lawn mowers, to be labeled with energy efficiency stickers to permit purchasers to make informed choices when buying such equipment. The statute does not expressly preempt state law. Assume that no other federal statute or administrative regulation addresses the energy efficiency of power equipment. Which of the following is the best argument the state can make for the continued validity of its law?  Choices: a. Congress cannot preempt state laws requiring a specified minimum level of requiring a specified minimum level of fuel efficiency for lawn mowers, because the use of such equipment is a wholly local event and, therefore, is beyond the regulatory authority vested in Congress by the commerce clause. OR b. The law is unaffected by the federal statute, because Congress did not expressly prohibit state laws requiring power equipment to meet specified levels of fuel efficiency. OR c. The purpose of the law is consistent with the purpose of the federal statute, enforcement of the law would not interfere with the full execution of the statute, and there is no evidence that Congress intended to preclude the states from enacting supplemental laws on this subject.

Although it is not the only lake in the county, it is the largest and most scenic, and it attracts visitors from miles around. One of its biggest assets is the excellent fishing and boating, which is available to the public at large. Three years ago, in order to enhance the recreational aspects of the lake, the county leased a sizable portion of the lake and surrounding parkland to a company owned by the most prominent family in the county. The lease required the company to construct and operate a first-rate yacht house and club, complete with bar, restaurant, and private marina, and to pay the county 10% of its net profits as rent. The company set up bylaws, which were reviewed and approved by the county at the time the lease was negotiated. According to the bylaws, the yacht club, complete with its restaurant and bar, would be open to members only, and the membership committee was empowered to set up strict membership \"standards,\" as well as the cost of membership fees and dues. Upon completion of the facilities, the state granted the company a license to sell alcoholic beverages in its restaurant and bar. The membership committee announced that the membership fee was $5,000 and the monthly dues $75. Furthermore, the membership committee had a policy of approving only membership applications from men, while disapproving and denying all applications from women. There were other similar facilities within the county available to women. A woman resident of the county brings suit against the company, claiming that her membership application was denied only because she is a woman, and that its policy of excluding women as a group denies her equal protection rights. Which of the following is the most accurate statement? Choices: a. The plaintiff will lose, because classifications based on sex have not yet been held to violate the equal protection clause. OR b.

The employer moved for summary judgment, alleging that the woman was a pathological liar who had filed the action and included fictitious documents in revenge for having been fired.

The homeowner received notice that her uncle had passed away and left her a two-story mansion in a neighboring city. The homeowner decided to move her primary residence to the mansion and rent the ranch-style home. She entered into a one- year written lease agreement with a tenant. The agreement set the monthly rent at $1,000. Shortly after the tenant took possession of the home, he built, at his own expense, a room addition onto the home. The room addition increased the appraised market value of the home from $200,000 to $250,000. At the expiration of the lease, the homeowner informed the tenant that she had decided to sell the home. She offered the tenant the first opportunity to buy the home, but the tenant replied that he could not afford to do so. The tenant did claim that he should be entitled to compensation for the room addition, since it had increased the value of the home, and the homeowner agreed. The tenant and the homeowner then executed the following agreement:\"On the sale of the ranch-style home, the homeowner hereby promises to pay the tenant one- half of any sale proceeds in excess of $200,000, in compensation of the tenant's efforts in constructing the room addition onto the home. In addition, it is hereby agreed that the tenant may remain on the land until the sale is finalized, at a monthly rent of$500. ,'The homeowner initially set the asking price at $250,000, but received no offers to purchase the home. The homeowner decided to reduce the price to $210,000. This price reduction so infuriated the tenant that he thereafter made negative comments about the home to all of the prospective buyers who visited the home. Two months later, the homeowner sold the home to a buyer for $206,000. The buyer had visited the home while the tenant was away on a business trip and therefore did not hear the tenant's negative comments. Thereupon, the tenant, who had paid no rent for the final two months, moved out. After the sale was finalized, the homeowner refused to pay the tenant any of the sale proceeds. Which of the following statements, if true, most persuasively supports the tenant's contention that he is entitled to recover at least $4,000 from the owner (or the equivalent of one-half of the sale proceeds in excess of $200,000, minus two months' unpaid rent at $500 per month)? Choices: a. The owner breached an implied promise by failing to attempt to sell the property at $250,000, which was the appraised market value of the home.  OR b. Since the tenant made no negative comments about the home to the buyer, there is no showing that the tenant's remarks to the other prospective buyers necessarily caused any loss to the owner (i. e. , prevented her from selling the home for more than $210,000).  OR c. The agreement between the homeowner that the tenant contained only one express condition (i. e. , the tenant was permitted to remain in the home during the owner's efforts to sell it), and since that condition has occurred, the tenant is entitled to his share of the proceeds from the sale.  OR d. Even if the tenant's failure to pay any rent for the last two months was a material breach of contract, the owner's promise to pay the tenant a share of the proceeds of the sale was an independent covenant.  Answer:\nb.

The letter did not say how the writer personally knew that there were drugs or where they were stored. The investigating detective drew up an affidavit of probable cause based on the statements in the letter and presented the request for a search warrant and the affidavit to a magistrate judge. The magistrate judge signed a search warrant based on the affidavit. The police raided the home and found several pounds of cocaine in the basement. The defendants filed a motion to suppress the evidence based on insufficient cause to issue a warrant. The state courts rejected the suppression motion. What would the U.S. Supreme Court most likely decide? Choices: a. The Court would validate the search warrant because there were sufficient detailed allegations in the letter to justify a probable cause finding. OR b. The Court would invalidate the warrant because there was insufficient information and no corroboration to support the credibility and personal knowledge of the informant. OR c. The warrant was valid because when the informant's information turns out to be true after the warrant is issued and executed, then that validates the affidavit of probable cause. OR d. The warrant was invalid because affidavits of probable cause must give the name and address of the informant; an affidavit cannot be based on an anonymous informant. Answer:\nb. The Court would invalidate the warrant because there was insufficient information and no corroboration to support the credibility and personal knowledge of the informant.\n\nQuestion: [question] Choices: [choices] Answer: [answer]\nQuestion: A developer, owner of several hundred acres in a rural county, drafted a general development plan for the area.

The statute authorized pari-mutuel betting at certain track locations within the state. A seven-member commission was established and empowered to supervise and regulate the sport's activities. Under an inseparable provision of the statute, the commission was authorized to suspend the racing license of any trainer whose horse tested positive for illegal drugs. The statute permitted the commission to make the suspension without any prior hearing. However, suspended trainers were entitled to a prompt post- suspension hearing and decision on any issues in dispute. The racing season was inaugurated at the largest racetrack in the state. The featured race was a $1,000,000 harness race for 2-year-old trotters. After the awards presentation, the winning horse underwent a standard drug test and traces of cocaine were found in his urine sample. Immediately thereafter, the horse was disqualified and the commission suspended the horse's trainer, without a prior hearing. Without seeking a post-suspension hearing as provided by statute, the trainer brings suit in federal district court challenging the constitutionality of the state harness racing law. The statute is probably Choices: a. constitutional, because being granted a racing license is a privilege, not a right.  OR b. constitutional, because the state's interest in suspending the license of horse trainers suspected of illegal drugging is sufficiently important to permit the suspension of any prior hearing.  OR c. unconstitutional, because the suspension provision unreasonably interferes with a trainer's right to contract with horse owners and seek gainful employment.  OR d. unconstitutional, because the suspension provision violates due process by not affording a prior hearing.

The treaty, which was ratified by the Senate, was supported by professional baseball and hockey players. Many Canadian hockey players, who were employed by American teams and lived in the United States during the hockey season, lobbied for passage of the treaty, since they were subject to the payment of both U. S. and Canadian income taxes. In like manner, many American baseball players, who lived in Canada during the baseball season, objected to the same dual taxation. In violation of the treaty, a Canadian court convicted a U. S. citizen who resided in Canada, of illegally evading the payment of Canadian income taxes. The U. S. citizen, who was a member of a Canadian baseball team, resided in Canada during the baseball season. Following his conviction, the President announced that the previously effective tax treaty would no longer be abided by the United States. The President proclaimed that Canada's refusal to honor the treaty rendered it invalid. As a result, the President ordered the Internal Revenue Service to begin collecting income taxes from Canadian citizens residing in the United States in the same manner that it collects taxes from other residents of this country. A Canadian citizen and resident of the United States, sues in an appropriate federal court, seeking a declaratory judgment that the treaty with Canada remains valid and effective.

When she arrived, the graduate was told that her job was contingent on passing the state bar examination, which was being offered in July. In preparing for the bar examination, the graduate planned to take a bar review course. Although she had not pre-enrolled, the graduate planned to attend and pay for the course at registration. On the morning the course was set to begin, the graduate arrived late after getting stuck in freeway traffic. By the time the graduate got to the course location, registration had already been completed. When the graduate looked into the room where the course was being conducted, she saw the lecture had begun, and everyone was inside busily taking notes. Panicky, the graduate picked up a set of course materials that were lying on the registration table and entered without paying. Although the graduate intended to pay the enrollment fee, no one was at the registration table to take her money. After attending the first couple of classes, the graduate sent a cashier's check for the full amount of the enrollment fee to the bar review company. Unbeknownst to the graduate, the bar review course's regional director noticed that she had entered the lectures without paying. After ascertaining her identity from a fellow student who knew the graduate, the company filed a complaint with the local prosecutor, and a warrant was issued for her arrest. The complaint charged the graduate with the crime of larceny by trick, for deliberately failing to pay for services rendered. After the complaint was issued, the graduate's check arrived at the company's office. The company deposited the check but failed to inform the prosecutor that payment had been received. The graduate was arrested and held in custody overnight before the matter was resolved. The graduate suffered severe emotional distress at the publicity she received in the local newspapers and the humiliation she suffered for being arrested and held in police custody. Terribly upset, the graduate was unable to take the bar exam and, thus, lost her job at the entertainment law firm. If the graduate asserts a claim against the bar-review company based on infliction of emotional distress, will she prevail? Choices: a. Yes, because the graduate did not intend to defraud the company. OR b. Yes, because the company made no effort to inform the prosecutor that the registration fee had been paid in full. OR c. No, because the company did not intend to cause the graduate to suffer severe emotional distress. OR d. No, because filing-the complaint with the prosecutor was not outrageous conduct.

The written contract entered included a \"production fee clause\" that provided that the production company would be \"paid $100,000 for the filming and editing of ten 30-second commercials\" that would be suitable for the candidate's television campaign broadcasts. The production fee clause also stipulated that the $100,000 would be paid to the production company \"on condition that the filming and editing be directed under the personal supervision of the president of the production company. \" The contract made no other reference to compensation. Thereafter, the production company filmed and edited the ten campaign commercials, which the candidate approved. When the production was completed, the production company submitted to the candidate an invoice statement in the amount of $150,000. Besides the $100,000 contract figure, the bill included a $50,000 charge for the president's full-time services in directing the filming and editing of the videos. Denying any additional liability, the candidate sent the production company a check for $100,000.

Some years prior to her death, she conveyed a deed in fee simple to her oldest son. After her death, her youngest son filed a claim against the estate contending that the father's will devised only a life estate to his wife. A state statute said that a fee simple would be presumed where the intent of the testator did not clearly show an intent to devise a lesser estate. The lower court held that the widow had received a defeasible fee conditioned on her remaining a widow. Because she did not marry, the deed to the son ripened into an indefeasible fee absolute at the time of conveyance. The younger son appealed. Will the appellate court likely reverse the lower court's decision and rule that the oldest son did not receive full title to the property? Choices: a. Yes, because it was a life estate that ends on her remarriage or death, with a remainder over to all of the sons. OR b. Yes, the deed could not convey more than a life estate because of the condition in the will. OR c.

While on the trip, the outdoorsman went deer hunting. He was in a very desolate area, surrounded by a densely wooded terrain, that was located at least 100 miles from any habitation. After a rather uneventful morning with nothing at which to shoot, the outdoorsman suddenly spotted a bald eagle; a nearly extinct bird.

The bill passed the state legislature at the urging of state and local law enforcement agencies who argued that tinted windows prevented them from observing interior car activity. Most citizens also supported the bill, especially after a state trooper was killed by an occupant in a window-tinted limousine. The trooper was unable to see that his assailant was armed and dangerous when he approached the vehicle for a speeding infraction. A limousine company operates a limo service in a neighboring state and has a fleet of 68 limos, all of which have tinted windows. Each year, the company makes thousands of trips into the state to transport passengers to the international airport situated 10 miles from the border separating the two states. Since all of its limos are manufactured with tinted windows, the company will incur great expense in ordering limos without tinting. The company brings suit to challenge the constitutionality of the state statute. Assuming that the company has proper standing to assert such an action, which of the following is their strongest constitutional argument to invalidate the aforesaid statute? Choices: a. Because window tinting is permitted on vehicles in neighboring states, this law denies the company the equal protection of laws. OR b.

On behalf of his company, he borrowed $500,000 from a credit union for this purpose. The company was to repay the loan at the rate of $2,500 per month. The loan was secured by a mortgage on the building that housed the company's operation center. Eight months later, the company's sales started to drop and the company began experiencing cash flow problems. As a result, the company failed to make its loan payments for three consecutive months, causing the credit union to threaten to foreclose on the mortgage. The president's father, a retired wealthy investor, then intervened on behalf of the company, paid the three missed loan payments, and told the credit union that if they would refrain from any legal action against the company for a year, he would personally see that the debt was paid. The credit union orally agreed to the father's surety arrangement. However, it was never reduced to writing. Six months later, the company once again missed consecutive payments, and the credit union filed a foreclosure suit against the company. The father did not learn of the suit until a week later, but he raised no objection, since he thought the credit union was violating its agreement with him by foreclosing within the one-year period, thus relieving him of his part of the bargain. Two weeks later, the credit union's loan officer called the father and said that the credit union would hold off on the foreclosure suit as per their agreement, since the company had just made a new technological development that would place it in a very lucrative and competitive position.

A state trooper is a member of the state police force, a law enforcement body that exercises broad police authority throughout the state. The position of state trooper is filled on the basis of competitive examinations taken by all of the applicants. After the resident alien applied for the position, the state authorities refused him permission to take the qualifying examination. The state authorities based their refusal on state statute, which provided:\"No person shall become a member of the state police unless he/she shall be a citizen of the United States. \"Thus, under this provision, as a prerequisite to becoming a member of the state police, an alien must relinquish his foreign citizenship and become a citizen. In an opinion upholding the validity of the statute, the State Attorney General noted that since police officers fall within the category of important non-elective officials who participate directly in the execution of broad public policy, only citizens of the United States should be qualified to apply for such positions. \"At the time the resident alien applied for a position as a state trooper, he was a citizen of a foreign country and not currently eligible for citizenship. As a result of a federal statute, Congress has imposed a five-year residency requirement for the attainment of citizenship. Under this federal law, an alien must reside in this country for a period of five years as a prerequisite before applying for citizenship.

In recent years, many outside organizations have entered the fairgrounds and distributed literature and paraphernalia to the many thousands of patrons visiting the fair. State fair officials did not endorse any of these organizations but permitted them to disseminate their materials throughout the fairgrounds without charge. Lately, however, many families attending the fair have complained about being harassed by canvassers from these various organizations. In an effort to protect the safety and welfare of the persons visiting the fair, the state legislature enacted a law prohibiting anyone from selling or distributing materials at the state fair. This new statute provided, however, that groups could pay a $50 license fee and distribute their literature from enclosed booths. These booths would be set up along the entrance to the fairgrounds and rented to anyone wishing to sell or distribute materials or soliciting money during the fair. The first year that the statute went into effect, approximately 40 groups rented booth space. There were various organizations paying the $50 license fee. A group of scientists opposed to the use of aerosol spray cans, requested permission to distribute literature at the fairgrounds. The scientists claimed that they simply wanted to warn people of the perils created by the disintegration of the ozone layer from the dispersion of fluorocarbons into the atmosphere. State fair officials offered to lease the scientists a booth at the $50 fee, but refused to permit solicitation activities outside the booth enclosures. The scientists were unwilling to pay the $50 license fee and instituted suit in state court seeking a court order permitting them to distribute literature anywhere in the fairgrounds area. Which of the following is the strongest argument insupport of the constitutionality of the statute? Choices: a.

The plant had been shut down for 10 years. Much to Darlene's chagrin, officials at the plant had announced plans to reopen the plant. Darlene, who was a waitress at a local restaurant, devised a scheme whereby she would contaminate oysters at her restaurant with small amounts of a poisonous substance. Although she didn't want to seriously injure anyone, Darlene believed that if some people got sick from eating the oysters, they would attribute their illness to nuclear waste from the power plant. To facilitate her plan, she stole some poison from a local pharmacy. She sprinkled it on some oysters at the restaurant where she worked. Mistakenly, she put too much of the poison on some of the oysters. A few of the customers who ate the oysters became sick and nauseated. One person suffered convulsions and died from the poisoning. A statute in the jurisdiction provides: \"Any intentional and premeditated killing, or one occurring during the perpetration of a felony, is murder in the first degree. Murder in the second degree is murder with intent to cause serious bodily harm. Manslaughter is an unlawful killing due to recklessness. \"Assault with intent to kill or to cause serious physical injury is a felony in the jurisdiction. There are no separate felonies relating to adulterating food or poisoning. The most serious crime for which Darlene can properly be convicted is Choices: a. first-degree murder, because her acts were intentional and premeditated.  OR b. first-degree murder, because the death occurred during the commission of a felony.  OR c. second-degree murder, because of the intent to cause physical harm.

In accordance with the new law, all beer consumed within the state must be sold in aluminum cans that are recyclable. There is a provision of the statute that does permit breweries to distribute beer to bars, taverns, and restaurants in kegs for \"on-site\" consumption by patrons. Before the passage of the law, approximately 28% of all beer consumed in the state was packaged in glass bottles. Of that total, 75% of the beer was bottled outside the state, while 25% was bottled by companies in-state. The legislature passed the law at the strong urging of the aluminum can industry. It was estimated that one aluminum company alone spent over $5,000,000 in its lobbying campaign for the passage of the bill.

Due to the precipitous drop in oil prices, many oil companies have been forced to cut back on oil production and lay off many workers. As a result, unemployment has reached all-time high levels in several states. In order to alleviate this potentially catastrophic situation, the one of those state's legislatures recently enacted a statute requiring that 10% of all oil produced within the state be purchased by the state and reserved for use by state residents. The purpose of the statute was twofold: (1) it was intended to stimulate the oil industry within the state by encouraging more production and exploration, and (2) it was designed to create an oil reserve so that state residents and industries would not suffer unduly from future oil shortages. Subsequently, Congress enacted a statute forbidding states to reserve local resources for local use in this manner. Is this state statute constitutional? Choices: a. Yes, because Congress has not expressly forbidden states to reserve local resources for local use.  OR b. Yes, because the state statute requires that the oil be used for the general welfare of the people in emergency situations.  OR c. No, because a state may not protect its residents from out-of-state competition for its natural resources without the express permission of Congress.  OR d.

The man was convicted of selling large quantities of an illegal drug from his house. Acting under a state law authorizing the destruction of buildings that are used for illegal activity, the city destroyed the man\u00d5s house. The man\u00d5s family then rented an apartment and demanded that the city pay the rent for that temporary residence. The family relied on a state law providing that any person who was dispossessed of his or her place of residence because of the actions of city officials was entitled to replacement housing at the city\u00d5s expense until permanent substitute housing could be found. When the city refused to pay the rent for the apartment, the man\u00d5s family sued the city in a state trial court claiming a right to such payment under both the state law and the due process clause of the Fourteenth Amendment to the United States Constitution. The highest state court ruled for the family. Although the court decided that the family had no right to payment under the state law, it held that the Fourteenth Amendment entitled the family to payment of the rent for the temporary apart-ment. In its opinion, the highest state court indicated that in several of its decisions it had found cities liable for compen-sation in similar situations on the basis of the due process clause of the state constitution.

A new federal statute requires all power equipment, including lawn mowers, to be labeled with energy efficiency stickers to permit purchasers to make informed choices when buying such equipment. The statute does not expressly preempt state law. Assume that no other federal statute or administrative regulation addresses the energy efficiency of power equipment. Which of the following is the best argument the state can make for the continued validity of its law?  Choices: a. Congress cannot preempt state laws requiring a specified minimum level of requiring a specified minimum level of fuel efficiency for lawn mowers, because the use of such equipment is a wholly local event and, therefore, is beyond the regulatory authority vested in Congress by the commerce clause. OR b. The law is unaffected by the federal statute, because Congress did not expressly prohibit state laws requiring power equipment to meet specified levels of fuel efficiency. OR c. The purpose of the law is consistent with the purpose of the federal statute, enforcement of the law would not interfere with the full execution of the statute, and there is no evidence that Congress intended to preclude the states from enacting supplemental laws on this subject. OR d. There is a very strong presumption that a specific state law on a subject normally within the state's police power prevails over a more general federal statute, because the Tenth Amendment reserves to the states primary authority over matters affecting public health, welfare, and safety. Answer:\nc. The purpose of the law is consistent with the purpose of the federal statute, enforcement of the law would not interfere with the full execution of the statute, and there is no evidence that Congress intended to preclude the states from enacting supplemental laws on this subject.\n\nQuestion: [question] Choices: [choices] Answer: [answer]\nQuestion: A woman who was three months pregnant enrolled in a pre-natal and post-natal exercise program at the local gymnasium.

In accordance with the new law, all beer consumed within the state must be sold in aluminum cans that are recyclable. There is a provision of the statute that does permit breweries to distribute beer to bars, taverns, and restaurants in kegs for \"on-site\" consumption by patrons. Before the passage of the law, approximately 28% of all beer consumed in the state was packaged in glass bottles. Of that total, 75% of the beer was bottled outside the state, while 25% was bottled by companies in-state. The legislature passed the law at the strong urging of the aluminum can industry. It was estimated that one aluminum company alone spent over $5,000,000 in its lobbying campaign for the passage of the bill. Ironically, the new law even received strong support from environmentalists who believed that recyclable cans would help prevent littering and unsightly trash accumulation. The strongest federal constitutional argument against the validity of the law is that it violates the Choices: a. equal protection clause of the Fourteenth Amendment by discriminating against beer bottlers. OR b. privileges or immunities clause of the Fourteenth Amendment by preventing out-of-state beer bottlers from conducting their business in the state.

Located below the ranch is a 40-acre farm that is owned by a farmer. There is a stream, which is a non-navigable watercourse, that originates at the top of the mountain and runs all the way down into the valley below. Both the ranch and the farm are within the watershed of the stream. When the farmer purchased the farm in 1974, he began taking water from the stream and used it to irrigate the southern half of his property which he has used as a farm. Prior to 1974, the southern half of the farm had been cleared and placed in cultivation, while the northern half remained wooded and unused except for an occasional hike or gathering of timber for use as domestic fuel. The farmer continued this established pattern of use. Now (January 2010), he is still taking water from the stream and using it to irrigate the southern half of the farm. In 2008, the rancher built a home on the ranch and began taking water from the stream for domestic purposes. During that year there was heavy rainfall, and this caused the stream to run down the mountain at a high water level. The next year, however, there was a drought. As a result, the stream flowed at a very low level. Consequently, there was only enough water to irrigate the farmer's farmland or, in the alternative, to supply all of the rancher's domestic water needs and one quarter of the farmer's irrigation requirements. The mountain is located in a jurisdiction where the period of prescription is 15 years. Inasmuch as the stream is still flowing at a very low level and the rancher is continuing to take water for his personal needs, there is insufficient water to irrigate the farm. As a consequence, the farmer brings an appropriate action to declare that his water rights to the stream are superior to those of the rancher. In addition, the farmer moves to have the full flow of the stream passed to him, notwithstanding the effect it might have on the rancher. If this state follows the doctrine of prior appropriation, judgment should be for whom? Choices: a. The rancher, because as an upstream landowner, he would have superior rights to the water than a downstream owner. OR b. The rancher, because domestic use is superior to and protected against an agricultural use. OR c.

The trial judge instructed the jury that \"the law presumes that a person intends the ordinary consequences of his voluntary acts.\" The judge did not tell them that they had a choice or could infer another conclusion; they were told only that the law presumed it. The accused was convicted of depraved heart murder and sentenced to 100 years in prison. On appeal, the appellant argued that the court took the fact-finding task of determining criminal intent out of the jury's hands by in effect ordering them to find intent. The jury could have felt that they were being told that they had no other choice. The state supreme court affirmed the conviction, but the United States Supreme Court granted certiorari. Will the Court likely reverse the conviction? Choices: a. Yes, because the wording of the instruction could have been viewed by jurors as a mandatory direction to find that there was intent to murder. OR b. Yes, because the wording in effect caused the defendant to be a witness against himself by having him intend everything that he did. OR c.

Due to the precipitous drop in oil prices, many oil companies have been forced to cut back on oil production and lay off many workers. As a result, unemployment has reached all-time high levels in several states. In order to alleviate this potentially catastrophic situation, the one of those state's legislatures recently enacted a statute requiring that 10% of all oil produced within the state be purchased by the state and reserved for use by state residents. The purpose of the statute was twofold: (1) it was intended to stimulate the oil industry within the state by encouraging more production and exploration, and (2) it was designed to create an oil reserve so that state residents and industries would not suffer unduly from future oil shortages. Subsequently, Congress enacted a statute forbidding states to reserve local resources for local use in this manner. Is this state statute constitutional? Choices: a. Yes, because Congress has not expressly forbidden states to reserve local resources for local use.  OR b. Yes, because the state statute requires that the oil be used for the general welfare of the people in emergency situations.  OR c. No, because a state may not protect its residents from out-of-state competition for its natural resources without the express permission of Congress.  OR d. No, because application of the statute denies non-oil producing companies to equal protection of the law, in violation of the Fourteenth Amendment.  Answer:\nc.

The plant had been shut down for 10 years. Much to Darlene's chagrin, officials at the plant had announced plans to reopen the plant. Darlene, who was a waitress at a local restaurant, devised a scheme whereby she would contaminate oysters at her restaurant with small amounts of a poisonous substance. Although she didn't want to seriously injure anyone, Darlene believed that if some people got sick from eating the oysters, they would attribute their illness to nuclear waste from the power plant. To facilitate her plan, she stole some poison from a local pharmacy. She sprinkled it on some oysters at the restaurant where she worked. Mistakenly, she put too much of the poison on some of the oysters. A few of the customers who ate the oysters became sick and nauseated. One person suffered convulsions and died from the poisoning. A statute in the jurisdiction provides: \"Any intentional and premeditated killing, or one occurring during the perpetration of a felony, is murder in the first degree. Murder in the second degree is murder with intent to cause serious bodily harm.

A new federal statute requires all power equipment, including lawn mowers, to be labeled with energy efficiency stickers to permit purchasers to make informed choices when buying such equipment. The statute does not expressly preempt state law. Assume that no other federal statute or administrative regulation addresses the energy efficiency of power equipment. Which of the following is the best argument the state can make for the continued validity of its law?  Choices: a. Congress cannot preempt state laws requiring a specified minimum level of requiring a specified minimum level of fuel efficiency for lawn mowers, because the use of such equipment is a wholly local event and, therefore, is beyond the regulatory authority vested in Congress by the commerce clause. OR b. The law is unaffected by the federal statute, because Congress did not expressly prohibit state laws requiring power equipment to meet specified levels of fuel efficiency. OR c. The purpose of the law is consistent with the purpose of the federal statute, enforcement of the law would not interfere with the full execution of the statute, and there is no evidence that Congress intended to preclude the states from enacting supplemental laws on this subject. OR d. There is a very strong presumption that a specific state law on a subject normally within the state's police power prevails over a more general federal statute, because the Tenth Amendment reserves to the states primary authority over matters affecting public health, welfare, and safety.

The cost of the two-week camp was advertised for $2,500, which included meals and housing.

The statute authorized pari-mutuel betting at certain track locations within the state. A seven-member commission was established and empowered to supervise and regulate the sport's activities. Under an inseparable provision of the statute, the commission was authorized to suspend the racing license of any trainer whose horse tested positive for illegal drugs. The statute permitted the commission to make the suspension without any prior hearing. However, suspended trainers were entitled to a prompt post- suspension hearing and decision on any issues in dispute. The racing season was inaugurated at the largest racetrack in the state. The featured race was a $1,000,000 harness race for 2-year-old trotters. After the awards presentation, the winning horse underwent a standard drug test and traces of cocaine were found in his urine sample. Immediately thereafter, the horse was disqualified and the commission suspended the horse's trainer, without a prior hearing. Without seeking a post-suspension hearing as provided by statute, the trainer brings suit in federal district court challenging the constitutionality of the state harness racing law. The statute is probably Choices: a. constitutional, because being granted a racing license is a privilege, not a right.  OR b. constitutional, because the state's interest in suspending the license of horse trainers suspected of illegal drugging is sufficiently important to permit the suspension of any prior hearing.  OR c. unconstitutional, because the suspension provision unreasonably interferes with a trainer's right to contract with horse owners and seek gainful employment.  OR d. unconstitutional, because the suspension provision violates due process by not affording a prior hearing.  Answer:\nb. constitutional, because the state's interest in suspending the license of horse trainers suspected of illegal drugging is sufficiently important to permit the suspension of any prior hearing. \n\nQuestion: [question] Choices: [choices] Answer: [answer]\nQuestion: Gary Gamer purchased a computer from Electronic Warehouse Inc.

While on the trip, the outdoorsman went deer hunting. He was in a very desolate area, surrounded by a densely wooded terrain, that was located at least 100 miles from any habitation. After a rather uneventful morning with nothing at which to shoot, the outdoorsman suddenly spotted a bald eagle; a nearly extinct bird.

Following their arrest, they were both taken to the police station and given Miranda warnings. They both expressed a desire to remain silent until they could consult an attorney. At the station house, they were booked and placed in separate jail cells. Later that day, and before any attorney consultations could take place, a police detective went to the coconspirator's cell and began interrogating him. The detective told the co-conspirator that if he cooperated in their investigation, the prosecuting attorney would drop charges against him. The co-conspirator then reluctantly confessed and implicated the defendant in the commission of the crimes. The co-conspirator also told the police where the defendant had hidden the stolen property.

The homeowner received notice that her uncle had passed away and left her a two-story mansion in a neighboring city. The homeowner decided to move her primary residence to the mansion and rent the ranch-style home. She entered into a one- year written lease agreement with a tenant. The agreement set the monthly rent at $1,000. Shortly after the tenant took possession of the home, he built, at his own expense, a room addition onto the home. The room addition increased the appraised market value of the home from $200,000 to $250,000. At the expiration of the lease, the homeowner informed the tenant that she had decided to sell the home. She offered the tenant the first opportunity to buy the home, but the tenant replied that he could not afford to do so. The tenant did claim that he should be entitled to compensation for the room addition, since it had increased the value of the home, and the homeowner agreed. The tenant and the homeowner then executed the following agreement:\"On the sale of the ranch-style home, the homeowner hereby promises to pay the tenant one- half of any sale proceeds in excess of $200,000, in compensation of the tenant's efforts in constructing the room addition onto the home. In addition, it is hereby agreed that the tenant may remain on the land until the sale is finalized, at a monthly rent of$500. ,'The homeowner initially set the asking price at $250,000, but received no offers to purchase the home. The homeowner decided to reduce the price to $210,000. This price reduction so infuriated the tenant that he thereafter made negative comments about the home to all of the prospective buyers who visited the home. Two months later, the homeowner sold the home to a buyer for $206,000. The buyer had visited the home while the tenant was away on a business trip and therefore did not hear the tenant's negative comments. Thereupon, the tenant, who had paid no rent for the final two months, moved out. After the sale was finalized, the homeowner refused to pay the tenant any of the sale proceeds. Which of the following statements, if true, most persuasively supports the tenant's contention that he is entitled to recover at least $4,000 from the owner (or the equivalent of one-half of the sale proceeds in excess of $200,000, minus two months' unpaid rent at $500 per month)? Choices: a. The owner breached an implied promise by failing to attempt to sell the property at $250,000, which was the appraised market value of the home.  OR b. Since the tenant made no negative comments about the home to the buyer, there is no showing that the tenant's remarks to the other prospective buyers necessarily caused any loss to the owner (i. e. , prevented her from selling the home for more than $210,000).  OR c. The agreement between the homeowner that the tenant contained only one express condition (i. e. , the tenant was permitted to remain in the home during the owner's efforts to sell it), and since that condition has occurred, the tenant is entitled to his share of the proceeds from the sale.  OR d. Even if the tenant's failure to pay any rent for the last two months was a material breach of contract, the owner's promise to pay the tenant a share of the proceeds of the sale was an independent covenant.  Answer:\nb.

On behalf of his company, he borrowed $500,000 from a credit union for this purpose. The company was to repay the loan at the rate of $2,500 per month. The loan was secured by a mortgage on the building that housed the company's operation center. Eight months later, the company's sales started to drop and the company began experiencing cash flow problems. As a result, the company failed to make its loan payments for three consecutive months, causing the credit union to threaten to foreclose on the mortgage. The president's father, a retired wealthy investor, then intervened on behalf of the company, paid the three missed loan payments, and told the credit union that if they would refrain from any legal action against the company for a year, he would personally see that the debt was paid. The credit union orally agreed to the father's surety arrangement. However, it was never reduced to writing. Six months later, the company once again missed consecutive payments, and the credit union filed a foreclosure suit against the company. The father did not learn of the suit until a week later, but he raised no objection, since he thought the credit union was violating its agreement with him by foreclosing within the one-year period, thus relieving him of his part of the bargain. Two weeks later, the credit union's loan officer called the father and said that the credit union would hold off on the foreclosure suit as per their agreement, since the company had just made a new technological development that would place it in a very lucrative and competitive position.

The plant had been shut down for 10 years. Much to Darlene's chagrin, officials at the plant had announced plans to reopen the plant. Darlene, who was a waitress at a local restaurant, devised a scheme whereby she would contaminate oysters at her restaurant with small amounts of a poisonous substance. Although she didn't want to seriously injure anyone, Darlene believed that if some people got sick from eating the oysters, they would attribute their illness to nuclear waste from the power plant. To facilitate her plan, she stole some poison from a local pharmacy. She sprinkled it on some oysters at the restaurant where she worked. Mistakenly, she put too much of the poison on some of the oysters. A few of the customers who ate the oysters became sick and nauseated. One person suffered convulsions and died from the poisoning. A statute in the jurisdiction provides: \"Any intentional and premeditated killing, or one occurring during the perpetration of a felony, is murder in the first degree. Murder in the second degree is murder with intent to cause serious bodily harm.

Several years later, at a time when the woman still owed the bank $750,000 on the mortgage loan, she sold the farm to a man for $900,000. The man paid the woman $150,000 in cash and specifically assumed the mortgage note. The bank received notice of this transaction and elected not to exer-cise the optional due-on-sale clause in the mortgage. Without informing the man, the bank later released the woman from any further personal liability on the note. After he had owned the farm for a number of years, the man defaulted on the loan. The bank properly accelerated the loan, and the farm was eventually sold at a foreclosure sale for $500,000.

The homeowner received notice that her uncle had passed away and left her a two-story mansion in a neighboring city. The homeowner decided to move her primary residence to the mansion and rent the ranch-style home. She entered into a one- year written lease agreement with a tenant. The agreement set the monthly rent at $1,000. Shortly after the tenant took possession of the home, he built, at his own expense, a room addition onto the home. The room addition increased the appraised market value of the home from $200,000 to $250,000. At the expiration of the lease, the homeowner informed the tenant that she had decided to sell the home. She offered the tenant the first opportunity to buy the home, but the tenant replied that he could not afford to do so. The tenant did claim that he should be entitled to compensation for the room addition, since it had increased the value of the home, and the homeowner agreed. The tenant and the homeowner then executed the following agreement:\"On the sale of the ranch-style home, the homeowner hereby promises to pay the tenant one- half of any sale proceeds in excess of $200,000, in compensation of the tenant's efforts in constructing the room addition onto the home. In addition, it is hereby agreed that the tenant may remain on the land until the sale is finalized, at a monthly rent of$500. ,'The homeowner initially set the asking price at $250,000, but received no offers to purchase the home. The homeowner decided to reduce the price to $210,000. This price reduction so infuriated the tenant that he thereafter made negative comments about the home to all of the prospective buyers who visited the home. Two months later, the homeowner sold the home to a buyer for $206,000. The buyer had visited the home while the tenant was away on a business trip and therefore did not hear the tenant's negative comments. Thereupon, the tenant, who had paid no rent for the final two months, moved out. After the sale was finalized, the homeowner refused to pay the tenant any of the sale proceeds. Which of the following statements, if true, most persuasively supports the tenant's contention that he is entitled to recover at least $4,000 from the owner (or the equivalent of one-half of the sale proceeds in excess of $200,000, minus two months' unpaid rent at $500 per month)? Choices: a. The owner breached an implied promise by failing to attempt to sell the property at $250,000, which was the appraised market value of the home.  OR b. Since the tenant made no negative comments about the home to the buyer, there is no showing that the tenant's remarks to the other prospective buyers necessarily caused any loss to the owner (i. e. , prevented her from selling the home for more than $210,000).  OR c. The agreement between the homeowner that the tenant contained only one express condition (i. e. , the tenant was permitted to remain in the home during the owner's efforts to sell it), and since that condition has occurred, the tenant is entitled to his share of the proceeds from the sale.  OR d. Even if the tenant's failure to pay any rent for the last two months was a material breach of contract, the owner's promise to pay the tenant a share of the proceeds of the sale was an independent covenant.  Answer:\nb.

The 80-acre tract included the family home, an exquisite mansion built in 1929 by a wealthy industrialist. For many years, the closest town to the tract had been in the grips of economic decline. However, in 1988 and 1989, several large corporations built plant facilities in the local area. By the early 1 990s, prosperity had burst upon the area. To take advantage of the real estate boom, the attorney divided the 80-acre tract into 160 lots. By 1995, the attorney had sold 90 lots to various individual buyers. Each deed contained the following provisions:\"It is an express covenant and condition that the property hereby conveyed shall not be used for other than single-family residences. \"\"The grantor hereby covenants for himself, his heirs, successors, and assigns to insert a similar restriction in all deeds to lots now owned by grantor in the 80- acre tract. \"In 1996, the county board of supervisors purchased from the attorney 30 lots within the 80-acre tract. The board, which had the power of eminent domain, planned to construct a new county pest-control office on the property. The deed of conveyance from the attorney to the county board of supervisors made no mention of the aforesaid restrictions contained in the deeds to other lot owners in the 80-acre tract.

The purchaser paid the property taxes but she failed to record the deed. She remained in open possession of the property. The original owner then attempted to sell the property five years later to another purchaser who did not know of the prior conveyance. The second purchaser performed a title search, checking the public records for deeds and saw that title was in the name of his seller. The search included obtaining a standard tax lien certificate, which showed that someone other than the titled owner had been paying the taxes for the past several years. He did not look into who had possession of the property, but went ahead with the closing, paid the purchase price, and recorded a warranty deed in the recorder of deeds office. The first purchaser found out about the sale and quickly recorded her warranty deed, but this was not done until about three months after the second purchaser's deed had already been recorded. The first purchaser also brought a quiet title action to have the court declare that she had superior ownership and title. Which of the two purchasers will win title to the property in a race-notice jurisdiction and why? Choices: a. The first purchaser wins because the second purchaser had constructive notice from the title search that someone else might be in possession, which triggered a duty to further investigate. OR b. The second purchaser will prevail because he recorded his deed first. OR c. The first purchaser will prevail because she paid the taxes on the property, and the tax lien certificate was legally treated the same as a recorded deed. OR d. The second purchaser wins because the first purchaser had to record her deed within five years in order to make it legal in a race-notice jurisdiction. Answer:\n", "Result": "b. The second purchaser will prevail because he recorded his deed first. In a race-notice jurisdiction, the first to record wins, regardless of who had possession of the property.

The home would house 200 beds for persons needing nursing home care for the remainder of their lives. The state government approved the request and certified the need for more nursing homes in that township.

In accordance with the new law, all beer consumed within the state must be sold in aluminum cans that are recyclable. There is a provision of the statute that does permit breweries to distribute beer to bars, taverns, and restaurants in kegs for \"on-site\" consumption by patrons. Before the passage of the law, approximately 28% of all beer consumed in the state was packaged in glass bottles. Of that total, 75% of the beer was bottled outside the state, while 25% was bottled by companies in-state. The legislature passed the law at the strong urging of the aluminum can industry. It was estimated that one aluminum company alone spent over $5,000,000 in its lobbying campaign for the passage of the bill. Ironically, the new law even received strong support from environmentalists who believed that recyclable cans would help prevent littering and unsightly trash accumulation. The strongest federal constitutional argument against the validity of the law is that it violates the Choices: a. equal protection clause of the Fourteenth Amendment by discriminating against beer bottlers. OR b. privileges or immunities clause of the Fourteenth Amendment by preventing out-of-state beer bottlers from conducting their business in the state.

The homeowner received notice that her uncle had passed away and left her a two-story mansion in a neighboring city. The homeowner decided to move her primary residence to the mansion and rent the ranch-style home. She entered into a one- year written lease agreement with a tenant. The agreement set the monthly rent at $1,000. Shortly after the tenant took possession of the home, he built, at his own expense, a room addition onto the home. The room addition increased the appraised market value of the home from $200,000 to $250,000. At the expiration of the lease, the homeowner informed the tenant that she had decided to sell the home. She offered the tenant the first opportunity to buy the home, but the tenant replied that he could not afford to do so. The tenant did claim that he should be entitled to compensation for the room addition, since it had increased the value of the home, and the homeowner agreed. The tenant and the homeowner then executed the following agreement:\"On the sale of the ranch-style home, the homeowner hereby promises to pay the tenant one- half of any sale proceeds in excess of $200,000, in compensation of the tenant's efforts in constructing the room addition onto the home. In addition, it is hereby agreed that the tenant may remain on the land until the sale is finalized, at a monthly rent of$500. ,'The homeowner initially set the asking price at $250,000, but received no offers to purchase the home. The homeowner decided to reduce the price to $210,000. This price reduction so infuriated the tenant that he thereafter made negative comments about the home to all of the prospective buyers who visited the home. Two months later, the homeowner sold the home to a buyer for $206,000. The buyer had visited the home while the tenant was away on a business trip and therefore did not hear the tenant's negative comments. Thereupon, the tenant, who had paid no rent for the final two months, moved out. After the sale was finalized, the homeowner refused to pay the tenant any of the sale proceeds. Which of the following statements, if true, most persuasively supports the tenant's contention that he is entitled to recover at least $4,000 from the owner (or the equivalent of one-half of the sale proceeds in excess of $200,000, minus two months' unpaid rent at $500 per month)? Choices: a. The owner breached an implied promise by failing to attempt to sell the property at $250,000, which was the appraised market value of the home.  OR b. Since the tenant made no negative comments about the home to the buyer, there is no showing that the tenant's remarks to the other prospective buyers necessarily caused any loss to the owner (i. e. , prevented her from selling the home for more than $210,000).  OR c. The agreement between the homeowner that the tenant contained only one express condition (i. e. , the tenant was permitted to remain in the home during the owner's efforts to sell it), and since that condition has occurred, the tenant is entitled to his share of the proceeds from the sale.  OR d. Even if the tenant's failure to pay any rent for the last two months was a material breach of contract, the owner's promise to pay the tenant a share of the proceeds of the sale was an independent covenant.  Answer:\nb.

Since she had just turned 16 and received her driver's license, she decided to purchase a motor scooter from a local retailer for $12,000. The written contract with the retailer provided that the girl would make monthly payments of $500 for two years. During the first year of the contract, the girl made 12 monthly payments totaling $6,000. However, the girl failed to make any payments during the second year of the contract. The retailer repeatedly threatened to sue the girl for the remaining balance that it claimed was due under the contract. However, the retailer never followed through on this threat. Shortly after the girl turned 18, she sent the following letter to the retailer:\"I had to stop making payments because I ran out of money. I am hoping that will change shortly. However, I've been told I am not obligated to pay anything more to you, because I was underage when we entered into the contract. But I want to be fair. I am willing to pay you $3,000 by the end of the year if my financial position improves. \"The girl never made any further payment to the retailer.

The statute authorized pari-mutuel betting at certain track locations within the state. A seven-member commission was established and empowered to supervise and regulate the sport's activities. Under an inseparable provision of the statute, the commission was authorized to suspend the racing license of any trainer whose horse tested positive for illegal drugs. The statute permitted the commission to make the suspension without any prior hearing. However, suspended trainers were entitled to a prompt post- suspension hearing and decision on any issues in dispute. The racing season was inaugurated at the largest racetrack in the state. The featured race was a $1,000,000 harness race for 2-year-old trotters. After the awards presentation, the winning horse underwent a standard drug test and traces of cocaine were found in his urine sample.

Due to the precipitous drop in oil prices, many oil companies have been forced to cut back on oil production and lay off many workers. As a result, unemployment has reached all-time high levels in several states. In order to alleviate this potentially catastrophic situation, the one of those state's legislatures recently enacted a statute requiring that 10% of all oil produced within the state be purchased by the state and reserved for use by state residents. The purpose of the statute was twofold: (1) it was intended to stimulate the oil industry within the state by encouraging more production and exploration, and (2) it was designed to create an oil reserve so that state residents and industries would not suffer unduly from future oil shortages. Subsequently, Congress enacted a statute forbidding states to reserve local resources for local use in this manner. Is this state statute constitutional? Choices: a. Yes, because Congress has not expressly forbidden states to reserve local resources for local use.  OR b. Yes, because the state statute requires that the oil be used for the general welfare of the people in emergency situations.  OR c. No, because a state may not protect its residents from out-of-state competition for its natural resources without the express permission of Congress.  OR d. No, because application of the statute denies non-oil producing companies to equal protection of the law, in violation of the Fourteenth Amendment.  Answer:\nc.

The home would house 200 beds for persons needing nursing home care for the remainder of their lives. The state government approved the request and certified the need for more nursing homes in that township. The township, however, vehemently opposed permitting a nursing home in a residential zoning district and refused the building permit. The township's zoning law has 15 residential zones, each of which does not allow a nursing home.

By the terms of the lease, the cousin expressly covenanted to pay a monthly rental of $300 and to pay the taxes on the premises during the term of the lease. The lease also stipulated that the cousin, as lessee, may not assign or sublease the said premises. The cousin and his family lived in the house for two years. Then the cousin, still owing the homeowner three months back rent, assigned his leasehold interest in the property to a friend, who was unaware of the prohibition against assignments.

The statute authorized pari-mutuel betting at certain track locations within the state. A seven-member commission was established and empowered to supervise and regulate the sport's activities. Under an inseparable provision of the statute, the commission was authorized to suspend the racing license of any trainer whose horse tested positive for illegal drugs. The statute permitted the commission to make the suspension without any prior hearing. However, suspended trainers were entitled to a prompt post- suspension hearing and decision on any issues in dispute. The racing season was inaugurated at the largest racetrack in the state. The featured race was a $1,000,000 harness race for 2-year-old trotters. After the awards presentation, the winning horse underwent a standard drug test and traces of cocaine were found in his urine sample. Immediately thereafter, the horse was disqualified and the commission suspended the horse's trainer, without a prior hearing. Without seeking a post-suspension hearing as provided by statute, the trainer brings suit in federal district court challenging the constitutionality of the state harness racing law. The statute is probably Choices: a. constitutional, because being granted a racing license is a privilege, not a right.  OR b. constitutional, because the state's interest in suspending the license of horse trainers suspected of illegal drugging is sufficiently important to permit the suspension of any prior hearing.  OR c. unconstitutional, because the suspension provision unreasonably interferes with a trainer's right to contract with horse owners and seek gainful employment.  OR d. unconstitutional, because the suspension provision violates due process by not affording a prior hearing.  Answer:\nb. constitutional, because the state's interest in suspending the license of horse trainers suspected of illegal drugging is sufficiently important to permit the suspension of any prior hearing. \n\nQuestion: [question] Choices: [choices] Answer: [answer]\nQuestion: An owner of land entered into a month-to-month lease with a chemical company.

Several years later, at a time when the woman still owed the bank $750,000 on the mortgage loan, she sold the farm to a man for $900,000. The man paid the woman $150,000 in cash and specifically assumed the mortgage note. The bank received notice of this transaction and elected not to exer-cise the optional due-on-sale clause in the mortgage. Without informing the man, the bank later released the woman from any further personal liability on the note. After he had owned the farm for a number of years, the man defaulted on the loan. The bank properly accelerated the loan, and the farm was eventually sold at a foreclosure sale for $500,000. Because there was still $600,000 owing on the note, the bank sued the man for the $100,000 deficiency. Is the man liable to the bank for the deficiency? Choices: a.

Shortly thereafter, while the purchaser was riding the bicycle along a city street, he saw a traffic light facing him turn from green to amber. He sped up, hoping to cross the intersection before the light turned red. However, the purchaser quickly realized that he could not do so and applied the brakes, which failed.

The man was convicted of selling large quantities of an illegal drug from his house. Acting under a state law authorizing the destruction of buildings that are used for illegal activity, the city destroyed the man\u00d5s house. The man\u00d5s family then rented an apartment and demanded that the city pay the rent for that temporary residence. The family relied on a state law providing that any person who was dispossessed of his or her place of residence because of the actions of city officials was entitled to replacement housing at the city\u00d5s expense until permanent substitute housing could be found. When the city refused to pay the rent for the apartment, the man\u00d5s family sued the city in a state trial court claiming a right to such payment under both the state law and the due process clause of the Fourteenth Amendment to the United States Constitution. The highest state court ruled for the family. Although the court decided that the family had no right to payment under the state law, it held that the Fourteenth Amendment entitled the family to payment of the rent for the temporary apart-ment. In its opinion, the highest state court indicated that in several of its decisions it had found cities liable for compen-sation in similar situations on the basis of the due process clause of the state constitution.

A nonresident, in order to hunt elk, was required to purchase a combination license at a cost of $225. 00; this entitled him to take one elk, one deer, and one black bear. A nonresident, however, could obtain a license restricted to deer for $51. 00. A resident was not required to buy any combination of licenses but if he did, the cost to him of all the privileges granted by the nonresident combination license was $30. 00. Due to its successful management program for elk, the state has not been compelled to limit the overall number of hunters by means of drawings or lotteries, as have other states. Elk are not hunted commercially in the state. Nonresident hunters seek the animal for its trophy value; the trophy is the distinctive set of antlers.  \u0080\u0098. Vhereas the interest of resident hunters more often may be in the meat, among nonresident hunters, big-game hunting is clearly a sport in the state. Two residents of another state bring suit against the state. They assert in their complaint that the disparities between residents and nonresidents in the state hunting license system is unconstitutional. The state's hunting license system should be found Choices: a. constitutional, because it is within the police power of a state to regulate a recreational, noncommercial activity.  OR b. constitutional, because there is a compelling state interest.  OR c. unconstitutional, because it violates the privileges and immunities clause of Article IV, Section 2.  OR d. unconstitutional, because it violates the equal protection clause of the Fourteenth Amendment.  Answer:\na. constitutional, because it is within the police power of a state to regulate a recreational, noncommercial activity. \n\nQuestion: [question] Choices: [choices] Answer: [answer]\nQuestion: One night, a defendant went to play bingo.

The stockbroker decided to end his life by jumping off a bridge. He walked to the middle of the bridge, climbed over the railing, stood on the tiny ledge on the edge of the bridge, and prepared to jump. A taxi driver who happened to be crossing the bridge at that moment saw what the stockbroker was doing. The taxi driver slammed on his brakes, jumped out of his taxi, started running toward the stockbroker, and yelled, \"Don't do it!\" Pleased to hear that someone cared about him, the stockbroker changed his mind about committing suicide and decided that he wanted to live. At that moment, however, the stockbroker started to lose his balance, and his feet began to slip off the small, grimy ledge of the bridge. Just as the stockbroker started to fall, the taxi driver reached him and grabbed the back of his jacket. The taxi driver hung on tightly to the jacket and nearly was pulled over the side of the bridge, but he managed to hang on. Using every bit of strength he could muster, the taxi driver pulled the stockbroker back up and onto the bridge. The stockbroker was relieved to have been saved from falling. Unfortunately, the taxi driver suffered a severe injury to his back from the strain of hanging on to the stockbroker and pulling him back up onto the bridge. A statute in the jurisdiction makes attempted suicide a crime. If the taxi driver asserts a claim against the stockbroker to recover damages for his injuries, will he prevail? Choices: a. No, because the stockbroker did not intend to harm anyone other than himself. OR b. No, because attempted suicide was a criminal offense in the jurisdiction. OR c.

A nonresident, in order to hunt elk, was required to purchase a combination license at a cost of $225. 00; this entitled him to take one elk, one deer, and one black bear. A nonresident, however, could obtain a license restricted to deer for $51. 00. A resident was not required to buy any combination of licenses but if he did, the cost to him of all the privileges granted by the nonresident combination license was $30. 00. Due to its successful management program for elk, the state has not been compelled to limit the overall number of hunters by means of drawings or lotteries, as have other states.

In accordance with the new law, all beer consumed within the state must be sold in aluminum cans that are recyclable. There is a provision of the statute that does permit breweries to distribute beer to bars, taverns, and restaurants in kegs for \"on-site\" consumption by patrons. Before the passage of the law, approximately 28% of all beer consumed in the state was packaged in glass bottles. Of that total, 75% of the beer was bottled outside the state, while 25% was bottled by companies in-state. The legislature passed the law at the strong urging of the aluminum can industry. It was estimated that one aluminum company alone spent over $5,000,000 in its lobbying campaign for the passage of the bill. Ironically, the new law even received strong support from environmentalists who believed that recyclable cans would help prevent littering and unsightly trash accumulation. The strongest federal constitutional argument against the validity of the law is that it violates the Choices: a. equal protection clause of the Fourteenth Amendment by discriminating against beer bottlers.

The state law, however, does permit illegitimate children to inherit from and through their mothers. A man died intestate, leaving neither spouse nor any children other than an illegitimate son. The man's wife and his daughter died one year later in a motor vehicle accident. The illegitimate son filed suit in an appropriate court alleging that the state statute, which bars an illegitimate child from sharing in his father's estate is invalid, and that he should be declared the lawful heir of the man's estate. In challenging the validity of the state statute, will the illegitimate son prevail? Choices: a. Yes, because most state laws that discriminate against illegitimate children have been invalidated to ensure that a state's concern over illicit relationships is not the basis for punitive measures against the product of such a relationship. OR b. Yes, because he has been deprived of property without due process, since his fundamental right to inherit has been compromised without a compelling state need. OR c. No, because a state may promote the just and expeditious disposition of property at death by denying intestate succession to all illegitimate children. OR d. No, because discrimination against illegitimate children is not suspect and, therefore, the law does not violate the equal protection clause if it is substantially related to a legitimate state interest.
