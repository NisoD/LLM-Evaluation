Due to the precipitous drop in oil prices, many oil companies have been forced to cut back on oil production and lay off many workers. As a result, unemployment has reached all-time high levels in several states. In order to alleviate this potentially catastrophic situation, the one of those state's legislatures recently enacted a statute requiring that 10% of all oil produced within the state be purchased by the state and reserved for use by state residents. The purpose of the statute was twofold: (1) it was intended to stimulate the oil industry within the state by encouraging more production and exploration, and (2) it was designed to create an oil reserve so that state residents and industries would not suffer unduly from future oil shortages. Subsequently, Congress enacted a statute forbidding states to reserve local resources for local use in this manner. Is this state statute constitutional? Choices: a. Yes, because Congress has not expressly forbidden states to reserve local resources for local use. , b. Yes, because the state statute requires that the oil be used for the general welfare of the people in emergency situations. , c. No, because a state may not protect its residents from out-of-state competition for its natural resources without the express permission of Congress. , d. No, because application of the statute denies non-oil producing companies to equal protection of the law, in violation of the Fourteenth Amendment.  Answer:\nc.

The leader of the foreign country sought the assistance of the United States in providing emergency aid. The President initially wanted to send troops from a west coast military base but learned that they were out on training maneuvers.

The so-called installment land contract has been popular as a substitute for the mortgage or deed of trust. Under such a contract, the seller agrees to accept, and the buyer agrees to pay, the purchase price in installments over a stipulated period of time. The vendor retains legal title as security for the payment of the purchase price; and the vendee has equitable title under the doctrine of equitable conversion. The most important characteristic of the installment land contract, however, is the forfeiture clause, which provides that if the vendee is in default for 30 days, the vendor may, at his option, declare a forfeiture of the contract, in which case all payments made shall be forfeited as \"liquidated\" damages and the buyer shall become a tenant at will of the seller. Over the years, many sellers of property under such installment land contracts have declared forfeitures in situations where the prospective buyers were delinquent in their payments, even when the buyer was late with a single payment after nearly all the other payments had been made. In order to remedy this inequitable situation, the state legislature enacted a statute requiring any seller attempting to declare a forfeiture of an installment land contract to do so by instituting a formal foreclosure action in the courts. The new law also provided that prior to the commencement of such a foreclosure action, the seller under such an arrangement must give the buyer a 60-day grace period to make up any delinquent installment payment with interest. The new law expressly applied both to installment land contracts entered into subsequent to its enactment and to installment land contracts already in existence at the time of its enactment. Is this new state statute likely to be held constitutional? Choices: a. Yes, because it is a reasonable regulation of the procedure to be followed in such cases and does not substantially diminish the underlying obligations of the buyer., b. Yes, because the authority to enact laws regulating real estate sales transactions occurring within the boundaries of individual states is reserved exclusively to the states by the Tenth Amendment., c. No, because application of the law to installment land contracts entered into prior to its enactment is a violation of the obligation of contracts., d. No, because application of the law to installment land contracts entered into before or after its enactment is a deprivation of a proprietary interest without due process of the law.

Yes, because the authority to enact laws regulating real estate sales transactions occurring within the boundaries of individual states is reserved exclusively to the states by the Tenth Amendment.\n\nQuestion: [question] Choices: [choices] Answer: [answer]\nQuestion: A man was arrested for driving under the influence of alcohol.

While in prison, federal authorities began investigating the murder of the defendant's 11-year- old stepdaughter who was murdered two years earlier. Believing that the defendant was responsible for this killing, federal agents decided to plant an informant at the prison to befriend the defendant and possibly obtain evidence about the crime. In accord with this plan, the federal agents hired a paid informant and placed him in the prison as a fellow inmate, masquerading as an organized crime figure. The informant soon befriended the defendant and learned that he was being threatened by other inmates because of a rumor that he had killed a child. The informant then raised the subject in several conversations, but the defendant repeatedly denied any such involvement. After the defendant started receiving tough treatment from other inmates because of the rumor, the informant offered to protect the defendant but told him, \"You have to tell me the truth about what really happened you know, if you want me to help you. \" Believing that the informant would protect him from the other inmates, the defendant then admitted to the informant that he had driven his stepdaughter to the desert where he killed her. Based upon this confession, the defendant was then indicted for the first-degree murder of his stepdaughter. Prior to trial, the defendant moves to suppress the statement given to the informant. Should the defendant's motion be granted? Choices: a.

In accordance with the new law, all beer consumed within the state must be sold in aluminum cans that are recyclable. There is a provision of the statute that does permit breweries to distribute beer to bars, taverns, and restaurants in kegs for \"on-site\" consumption by patrons. Before the passage of the law, approximately 28% of all beer consumed in the state was packaged in glass bottles. Of that total, 75% of the beer was bottled outside the state, while 25% was bottled by companies in-state. The legislature passed the law at the strong urging of the aluminum can industry. It was estimated that one aluminum company alone spent over $5,000,000 in its lobbying campaign for the passage of the bill.

Which of the following is the best argument the state can make for the continued validity of its law?  Choices: a.

The rental agreement provided that the land was to be used as farmland. Shortly after the tenant took possession of the tract of land, he built thereon, at his own expense, a barn made of lumber, which was 15 feet wide, 20 feet long, and set on loose bricks. The barn increased the appraised market value of the tract of land from $250,000 to $275,000. The tenant then began farming operations on the land. Toward the end of the lease period, the owner informed the tenant that he was going to put the tract of land up for sale. The next month, when the lease expired, the parties settled a dispute over the tenant's right, if any, to compensation for the improvements by the following written agreement:\"On the sale of the tract of land, the owner hereby agrees to pay the tenant two-thirds of any sale proceeds in excess of $250,000, provided that tenant may remain on the farm for the next year, rent-free, while the owner tries to sell it. After that time, the tenant may remain on the land until closing of the sale, at a monthly rental of $1,000. \"The owner initially set the asking price at $300,000. After receiving scant interest, the owner decided to reduce the price to $260,000. This price reduction so infuriated the tenant that he thereafter made negative comments about the farm to all of the prospective buyers. Finally, 14 months after the agreement between the owner and the tenant was executed, and after rejecting offers for $240,000 and $250,000, the owner sold the tract of land for $256,000 to a buyer who visited the land while the tenant was away on vacation. Thereupon, the tenant, who had failed to pay the last two months rent as per the agreement, moved out. After closing, the owner refused to pay the tenant any of the sale proceeds, and the tenant brought suit to recover damages for breach of contract. Which of the following is the owner's most persuasive argument in defense of the tenant's suit? Choices: a. The tenant committed an uncured material breach of an implied promise to cooperate in the owner's efforts to sell the property, or at least not to hinder the proposed sale., b. The tenant's negative comments about the farm to prospective buyers amounted to an anticipatory repudiation of the agreement between the owner and the tenant., c. The tenant's failure to pay any rent for the last two months was a material breach of contract that discharged the owner's remaining duties of performance., d.

The statute authorized pari-mutuel betting at certain track locations within the state. A seven-member commission was established and empowered to supervise and regulate the sport's activities. Under an inseparable provision of the statute, the commission was authorized to suspend the racing license of any trainer whose horse tested positive for illegal drugs. The statute permitted the commission to make the suspension without any prior hearing. However, suspended trainers were entitled to a prompt post- suspension hearing and decision on any issues in dispute. The racing season was inaugurated at the largest racetrack in the state. The featured race was a $1,000,000 harness race for 2-year-old trotters. After the awards presentation, the winning horse underwent a standard drug test and traces of cocaine were found in his urine sample. Immediately thereafter, the horse was disqualified and the commission suspended the horse's trainer, without a prior hearing. Without seeking a post-suspension hearing as provided by statute, the trainer brings suit in federal district court challenging the constitutionality of the state harness racing law. The statute is probably Choices: a. constitutional, because being granted a racing license is a privilege, not a right. , b. constitutional, because the state's interest in suspending the license of horse trainers suspected of illegal drugging is sufficiently important to permit the suspension of any prior hearing. , c. unconstitutional, because the suspension provision unreasonably interferes with a trainer's right to contract with horse owners and seek gainful employment. , d. unconstitutional, because the suspension provision violates due process by not affording a prior hearing.

Congress cannot preempt state laws requiring a specified minimum level of requiring a specified minimum level of fuel efficiency for lawn mowers, because the use of such equipment is a wholly local event and, therefore, is beyond the regulatory authority vested in Congress by the commerce clause., b. The law is unaffected by the federal statute, because Congress did not expressly prohibit state laws requiring power equipment to meet specified levels of fuel efficiency., c. The purpose of the law is consistent with the purpose of the federal statute, enforcement of the law would not interfere with the full execution of the statute, and there is no evidence that Congress intended to preclude the states from enacting supplemental laws on this subject., d. There is a very strong presumption that a specific state law on a subject normally within the state's police power prevails over a more general federal statute, because the Tenth Amendment reserves to the states primary authority over matters affecting public health, welfare, and safety. Answer:\nc. The purpose of the law is consistent with the purpose of the federal statute, enforcement of the law would not interfere with the full execution of the statute, and there is no evidence that Congress intended to preclude the states from enacting supplemental laws on this subject.\n\nQuestion: [question] Choices: [choices] Answer: [answer]\nQuestion: An elderly man employed an attorney to make up his will.

The homeowner received notice that her uncle had passed away and left her a two-story mansion in a neighboring city. The homeowner decided to move her primary residence to the mansion and rent the ranch-style home. She entered into a one- year written lease agreement with a tenant. The agreement set the monthly rent at $1,000. Shortly after the tenant took possession of the home, he built, at his own expense, a room addition onto the home. The room addition increased the appraised market value of the home from $200,000 to $250,000. At the expiration of the lease, the homeowner informed the tenant that she had decided to sell the home. She offered the tenant the first opportunity to buy the home, but the tenant replied that he could not afford to do so. The tenant did claim that he should be entitled to compensation for the room addition, since it had increased the value of the home, and the homeowner agreed. The tenant and the homeowner then executed the following agreement:\"On the sale of the ranch-style home, the homeowner hereby promises to pay the tenant one- half of any sale proceeds in excess of $200,000, in compensation of the tenant's efforts in constructing the room addition onto the home. In addition, it is hereby agreed that the tenant may remain on the land until the sale is finalized, at a monthly rent of$500. ,'The homeowner initially set the asking price at $250,000, but received no offers to purchase the home. The homeowner decided to reduce the price to $210,000. This price reduction so infuriated the tenant that he thereafter made negative comments about the home to all of the prospective buyers who visited the home. Two months later, the homeowner sold the home to a buyer for $206,000. The buyer had visited the home while the tenant was away on a business trip and therefore did not hear the tenant's negative comments. Thereupon, the tenant, who had paid no rent for the final two months, moved out. After the sale was finalized, the homeowner refused to pay the tenant any of the sale proceeds. Which of the following statements, if true, most persuasively supports the tenant's contention that he is entitled to recover at least $4,000 from the owner (or the equivalent of one-half of the sale proceeds in excess of $200,000, minus two months' unpaid rent at $500 per month)? Choices: a. The owner breached an implied promise by failing to attempt to sell the property at $250,000, which was the appraised market value of the home. , b. Since the tenant made no negative comments about the home to the buyer, there is no showing that the tenant's remarks to the other prospective buyers necessarily caused any loss to the owner (i. e. , prevented her from selling the home for more than $210,000). , c. The agreement between the homeowner that the tenant contained only one express condition (i. e. , the tenant was permitted to remain in the home during the owner's efforts to sell it), and since that condition has occurred, the tenant is entitled to his share of the proceeds from the sale. , d. Even if the tenant's failure to pay any rent for the last two months was a material breach of contract, the owner's promise to pay the tenant a share of the proceeds of the sale was an independent covenant.  Answer:\nb. Since the tenant made no negative comments about the home to the buyer, there is no showing that the tenant's remarks to the other prospective buyers necessarily caused any loss to the owner (i. e. , prevented her from selling the home for more than $210,000). \n\nQuestion: [question] Choices: [choices] Answer: [answer]\nQuestion: Which of the following is false about ex post facto laws?

Due to the precipitous drop in oil prices, many oil companies have been forced to cut back on oil production and lay off many workers. As a result, unemployment has reached all-time high levels in several states. In order to alleviate this potentially catastrophic situation, the one of those state's legislatures recently enacted a statute requiring that 10% of all oil produced within the state be purchased by the state and reserved for use by state residents. The purpose of the statute was twofold: (1) it was intended to stimulate the oil industry within the state by encouraging more production and exploration, and (2) it was designed to create an oil reserve so that state residents and industries would not suffer unduly from future oil shortages. Subsequently, Congress enacted a statute forbidding states to reserve local resources for local use in this manner. Is this state statute constitutional? Choices: a. Yes, because Congress has not expressly forbidden states to reserve local resources for local use. , b. Yes, because the state statute requires that the oil be used for the general welfare of the people in emergency situations. , c. No, because a state may not protect its residents from out-of-state competition for its natural resources without the express permission of Congress. , d. No, because application of the statute denies non-oil producing companies to equal protection of the law, in violation of the Fourteenth Amendment.  Answer:\nc. No, because a state may not protect its residents from out-of-state competition for its natural resources without the express permission of Congress. \n\nQuestion: [question] Choices: [choices] Answer: [answer]\nQuestion: Four hours into a defendant's assault trial, the lawyers gathered in the judge's chambers to discuss an evidentiary issue.

On behalf of his company, he borrowed $500,000 from a credit union for this purpose. The company was to repay the loan at the rate of $2,500 per month. The loan was secured by a mortgage on the building that housed the company's operation center. Eight months later, the company's sales started to drop and the company began experiencing cash flow problems. As a result, the company failed to make its loan payments for three consecutive months, causing the credit union to threaten to foreclose on the mortgage. The president's father, a retired wealthy investor, then intervened on behalf of the company, paid the three missed loan payments, and told the credit union that if they would refrain from any legal action against the company for a year, he would personally see that the debt was paid. The credit union orally agreed to the father's surety arrangement. However, it was never reduced to writing. Six months later, the company once again missed consecutive payments, and the credit union filed a foreclosure suit against the company. The father did not learn of the suit until a week later, but he raised no objection, since he thought the credit union was violating its agreement with him by foreclosing within the one-year period, thus relieving him of his part of the bargain. Two weeks later, the credit union's loan officer called the father and said that the credit union would hold off on the foreclosure suit as per their agreement, since the company had just made a new technological development that would place it in a very lucrative and competitive position.

A nonresident, in order to hunt elk, was required to purchase a combination license at a cost of $225. 00; this entitled him to take one elk, one deer, and one black bear. A nonresident, however, could obtain a license restricted to deer for $51. 00. A resident was not required to buy any combination of licenses but if he did, the cost to him of all the privileges granted by the nonresident combination license was $30. 00. Due to its successful management program for elk, the state has not been compelled to limit the overall number of hunters by means of drawings or lotteries, as have other states. Elk are not hunted commercially in the state. Nonresident hunters seek the animal for its trophy value; the trophy is the distinctive set of antlers.  \u0080\u0098. Vhereas the interest of resident hunters more often may be in the meat, among nonresident hunters, big-game hunting is clearly a sport in the state. Two residents of another state bring suit against the state. They assert in their complaint that the disparities between residents and nonresidents in the state hunting license system is unconstitutional. The state's hunting license system should be found Choices: a. constitutional, because it is within the police power of a state to regulate a recreational, noncommercial activity. , b. constitutional, because there is a compelling state interest. , c. unconstitutional, because it violates the privileges and immunities clause of Article IV, Section 2. , d. unconstitutional, because it violates the equal protection clause of the Fourteenth Amendment.

The man\u00d5s family then rented an apartment and demanded that the city pay the rent for that temporary residence. The family relied on a state law providing that any person who was dispossessed of his or her place of residence because of the actions of city officials was entitled to replacement housing at the city\u00d5s expense until permanent substitute housing could be found. When the city refused to pay the rent for the apartment, the man\u00d5s family sued the city in a state trial court claiming a right to such payment under both the state law and the due process clause of the Fourteenth Amendment to the United States Constitution. The highest state court ruled for the family. Although the court decided that the family had no right to payment under the state law, it held that the Fourteenth Amendment entitled the family to payment of the rent for the temporary apart-ment.

They had been employed by the casino for four years. One day, they were unexpectedly fired by the casino's new manager. Apparently, the casino hired the new manager to get rid of some of the old-time employees and replace them with new personnel at a lower wage. Angered by their firing, the codefendants vowed to get back at the casino. As their revenge, they decided to plant a bomb in the casino and demand $1,000,000. After receiving the money, they would then reveal the location of the bomb and provide details for defusing it. The co-defendants agreed that the casino should be given adequate warning so that nobody would be injured. In accordance with their plan, one of the co-defendants, who was an electronics expert, built the bomb himself. He alone then drove to the casino where he placed the bomb in a hallway closet. Shortly thereafter, the other co-defendant phoned the casino and made a demand for the money. He said a bomb was in the casino and that it would explode in 24 hours unless the money was paid. The casino treated their demand as a crank call and refused to make any payment. With their plans having gone awry, the codefendants agreed that one of them should return to the casino and defuse the bomb. As one of the co-defendants was driving back to the casino, the bomb exploded, killing 30 people. A subsequent investigation revealed that a faulty wire caused the bomb to detonate prematurely. A state statute provides that detonating or attempting to detonate a bomb or explosive device in or near a building or dwelling is a felony. If the co-defendants are charged with violating the aforementioned statute, which of the following statements is correct? Choices: a. Both are guilty, because each participated in the planning of the crime., b. The co-defendant who built the bomb is guilty, because he built and transported the bomb, but the other co-defendant is not guilty, because his phone call was not a substantial step in the furtherance of the crime., c. Neither is guilty, because the casino's gross negligence in failing to heed the telephone warning constituted an independent intervening cause of the explosion., d.

The statute authorized pari-mutuel betting at certain track locations within the state. A seven-member commission was established and empowered to supervise and regulate the sport's activities. Under an inseparable provision of the statute, the commission was authorized to suspend the racing license of any trainer whose horse tested positive for illegal drugs. The statute permitted the commission to make the suspension without any prior hearing. However, suspended trainers were entitled to a prompt post- suspension hearing and decision on any issues in dispute. The racing season was inaugurated at the largest racetrack in the state. The featured race was a $1,000,000 harness race for 2-year-old trotters. After the awards presentation, the winning horse underwent a standard drug test and traces of cocaine were found in his urine sample. Immediately thereafter, the horse was disqualified and the commission suspended the horse's trainer, without a prior hearing. Without seeking a post-suspension hearing as provided by statute, the trainer brings suit in federal district court challenging the constitutionality of the state harness racing law. The statute is probably Choices: a. constitutional, because being granted a racing license is a privilege, not a right. , b. constitutional, because the state's interest in suspending the license of horse trainers suspected of illegal drugging is sufficiently important to permit the suspension of any prior hearing. , c. unconstitutional, because the suspension provision unreasonably interferes with a trainer's right to contract with horse owners and seek gainful employment. , d. unconstitutional, because the suspension provision violates due process by not affording a prior hearing.

The statute authorized pari-mutuel betting at certain track locations within the state. A seven-member commission was established and empowered to supervise and regulate the sport's activities. Under an inseparable provision of the statute, the commission was authorized to suspend the racing license of any trainer whose horse tested positive for illegal drugs. The statute permitted the commission to make the suspension without any prior hearing. However, suspended trainers were entitled to a prompt post- suspension hearing and decision on any issues in dispute. The racing season was inaugurated at the largest racetrack in the state.

Without seeking a post-suspension hearing as provided by statute, the trainer brings suit in federal district court challenging the constitutionality of the state harness racing law. The statute is probably Choices: a. constitutional, because being granted a racing license is a privilege, not a right. , b. constitutional, because the state's interest in suspending the license of horse trainers suspected of illegal drugging is sufficiently important to permit the suspension of any prior hearing. , c. unconstitutional, because the suspension provision unreasonably interferes with a trainer's right to contract with horse owners and seek gainful employment. , d. unconstitutional, because the suspension provision violates due process by not affording a prior hearing.

Several years later, at a time when the woman still owed the bank $750,000 on the mortgage loan, she sold the farm to a man for $900,000. The man paid the woman $150,000 in cash and specifically assumed the mortgage note. The bank received notice of this transaction and elected not to exer-cise the optional due-on-sale clause in the mortgage. Without informing the man, the bank later released the woman from any further personal liability on the note. After he had owned the farm for a number of years, the man defaulted on the loan. The bank properly accelerated the loan, and the farm was eventually sold at a foreclosure sale for $500,000. Because there was still $600,000 owing on the note, the bank sued the man for the $100,000 deficiency. Is the man liable to the bank for the deficiency? Choices: a. No, because the woman would have still been primarily liable for payment, but the bank had released her from personal liability., b. No, because the bank\u00d5s release of the woman from per-sonal liability also released the man., c. Yes, because the bank\u00d5s release of the woman consti-tuted a clogging of the equity of redemption., d.

The plant had been shut down for 10 years. Much to Darlene's chagrin, officials at the plant had announced plans to reopen the plant. Darlene, who was a waitress at a local restaurant, devised a scheme whereby she would contaminate oysters at her restaurant with small amounts of a poisonous substance. Although she didn't want to seriously injure anyone, Darlene believed that if some people got sick from eating the oysters, they would attribute their illness to nuclear waste from the power plant. To facilitate her plan, she stole some poison from a local pharmacy. She sprinkled it on some oysters at the restaurant where she worked. Mistakenly, she put too much of the poison on some of the oysters. A few of the customers who ate the oysters became sick and nauseated. One person suffered convulsions and died from the poisoning. A statute in the jurisdiction provides: \"Any intentional and premeditated killing, or one occurring during the perpetration of a felony, is murder in the first degree. Murder in the second degree is murder with intent to cause serious bodily harm. Manslaughter is an unlawful killing due to recklessness. \"Assault with intent to kill or to cause serious physical injury is a felony in the jurisdiction. There are no separate felonies relating to adulterating food or poisoning. The most serious crime for which Darlene can properly be convicted is Choices: a. first-degree murder, because her acts were intentional and premeditated. , b. first-degree murder, because the death occurred during the commission of a felony. , c. second-degree murder, because of the intent to cause physical harm. , d. manslaughter, because her conduct was reckless.

The man was convicted of selling large quantities of an illegal drug from his house. Acting under a state law authorizing the destruction of buildings that are used for illegal activity, the city destroyed the man\u00d5s house. The man\u00d5s family then rented an apartment and demanded that the city pay the rent for that temporary residence. The family relied on a state law providing that any person who was dispossessed of his or her place of residence because of the actions of city officials was entitled to replacement housing at the city\u00d5s expense until permanent substitute housing could be found. When the city refused to pay the rent for the apartment, the man\u00d5s family sued the city in a state trial court claiming a right to such payment under both the state law and the due process clause of the Fourteenth Amendment to the United States Constitution. The highest state court ruled for the family. Although the court decided that the family had no right to payment under the state law, it held that the Fourteenth Amendment entitled the family to payment of the rent for the temporary apart-ment. In its opinion, the highest state court indicated that in several of its decisions it had found cities liable for compen-sation in similar situations on the basis of the due process clause of the state constitution. But the highest state court declined to base its holding on the state constitution because that issue had not been properly raised in the case. The city then filed a petition for a writ of certiorari in the United States Supreme Court. Does the Court have jurisdiction to review the merits of this case? Choices: a. Yes, because the highest state court based its decision wholly on federal law grounds., b. Yes, because the federal and state law issues in this case are so intertwined that a resolution of the federal law issues is necessary to facilitate a proper determination of the state law issues., c. No, because the decision of the highest state court ren-ders the case moot., d. No, because independent state law grounds could have been used to justify the result in this case. Answer:\na.

The homeowner received notice that her uncle had passed away and left her a two-story mansion in a neighboring city. The homeowner decided to move her primary residence to the mansion and rent the ranch-style home. She entered into a one- year written lease agreement with a tenant. The agreement set the monthly rent at $1,000. Shortly after the tenant took possession of the home, he built, at his own expense, a room addition onto the home. The room addition increased the appraised market value of the home from $200,000 to $250,000. At the expiration of the lease, the homeowner informed the tenant that she had decided to sell the home. She offered the tenant the first opportunity to buy the home, but the tenant replied that he could not afford to do so. The tenant did claim that he should be entitled to compensation for the room addition, since it had increased the value of the home, and the homeowner agreed. The tenant and the homeowner then executed the following agreement:\"On the sale of the ranch-style home, the homeowner hereby promises to pay the tenant one- half of any sale proceeds in excess of $200,000, in compensation of the tenant's efforts in constructing the room addition onto the home. In addition, it is hereby agreed that the tenant may remain on the land until the sale is finalized, at a monthly rent of$500. ,'The homeowner initially set the asking price at $250,000, but received no offers to purchase the home. The homeowner decided to reduce the price to $210,000. This price reduction so infuriated the tenant that he thereafter made negative comments about the home to all of the prospective buyers who visited the home. Two months later, the homeowner sold the home to a buyer for $206,000. The buyer had visited the home while the tenant was away on a business trip and therefore did not hear the tenant's negative comments. Thereupon, the tenant, who had paid no rent for the final two months, moved out. After the sale was finalized, the homeowner refused to pay the tenant any of the sale proceeds. Which of the following statements, if true, most persuasively supports the tenant's contention that he is entitled to recover at least $4,000 from the owner (or the equivalent of one-half of the sale proceeds in excess of $200,000, minus two months' unpaid rent at $500 per month)? Choices: a. The owner breached an implied promise by failing to attempt to sell the property at $250,000, which was the appraised market value of the home. , b. Since the tenant made no negative comments about the home to the buyer, there is no showing that the tenant's remarks to the other prospective buyers necessarily caused any loss to the owner (i. e. , prevented her from selling the home for more than $210,000). , c. The agreement between the homeowner that the tenant contained only one express condition (i. e. , the tenant was permitted to remain in the home during the owner's efforts to sell it), and since that condition has occurred, the tenant is entitled to his share of the proceeds from the sale. , d. Even if the tenant's failure to pay any rent for the last two months was a material breach of contract, the owner's promise to pay the tenant a share of the proceeds of the sale was an independent covenant.  Answer:\nb. Since the tenant made no negative comments about the home to the buyer, there is no showing that the tenant's remarks to the other prospective buyers necessarily caused any loss to the owner (i. e. , prevented her from selling the home for more than $210,000). \n\nQuestion: [question] Choices: [choices] Answer: [answer]\nQuestion: On September 1, a buyer contracted to buy 1000 widgets from a seller at $10 per widget, delivery to take place on or before September 15.

The home would house 200 beds for persons needing nursing home care for the remainder of their lives. The state government approved the request and certified the need for more nursing homes in that township. The township, however, vehemently opposed permitting a nursing home in a residential zoning district and refused the building permit. The township's zoning law has 15 residential zones, each of which does not allow a nursing home. The nursing home sued in federal court requesting declaratory and injunctive relief on the basis that the zoning law was discriminatory against handicapped persons and a violation of federal law. Will the court compel the township to allow the construction of the nursing home? Choices: a. Yes, under federal law all municipalities must provide reasonable accommodations to handicapped persons, and the zoning law in question violates that mandate., b. No, it is strictly a matter of local preference whether a particular use will be allowed in a zoning district., c.

The city's agent got a commitment from a major business corporation to build a large research center in the targeted area, which would bring new jobs and increased tax revenue. The city brought eminent domain proceedings to free up some 200 acres of land in the selected area. Although the city successfully condemned most of the privately-owned properties, it failed to reach agreement with nine residential property owners. Those owners brought suit seeking an injunction to prevent the taking.

Due to the precipitous drop in oil prices, many oil companies have been forced to cut back on oil production and lay off many workers. As a result, unemployment has reached all-time high levels in several states. In order to alleviate this potentially catastrophic situation, the one of those state's legislatures recently enacted a statute requiring that 10% of all oil produced within the state be purchased by the state and reserved for use by state residents. The purpose of the statute was twofold: (1) it was intended to stimulate the oil industry within the state by encouraging more production and exploration, and (2) it was designed to create an oil reserve so that state residents and industries would not suffer unduly from future oil shortages. Subsequently, Congress enacted a statute forbidding states to reserve local resources for local use in this manner. Is this state statute constitutional? Choices: a. Yes, because Congress has not expressly forbidden states to reserve local resources for local use. , b. Yes, because the state statute requires that the oil be used for the general welfare of the people in emergency situations. , c. No, because a state may not protect its residents from out-of-state competition for its natural resources without the express permission of Congress. , d.

The defendants claim bias, lack of scientific support, failure to conduct testing, divergence of opinion among experts, and that the expert was trained for large commercial fires. The expert had investigated over 500 fires, wrote a book that was used in courses nationwide and taught a course in forensic fire investigations in a university. Her report ruled out all other possible causes.

Although she didn't want to seriously injure anyone, Darlene believed that if some people got sick from eating the oysters, they would attribute their illness to nuclear waste from the power plant. To facilitate her plan, she stole some poison from a local pharmacy. She sprinkled it on some oysters at the restaurant where she worked. Mistakenly, she put too much of the poison on some of the oysters. A few of the customers who ate the oysters became sick and nauseated. One person suffered convulsions and died from the poisoning. A statute in the jurisdiction provides: \"Any intentional and premeditated killing, or one occurring during the perpetration of a felony, is murder in the first degree. Murder in the second degree is murder with intent to cause serious bodily harm. Manslaughter is an unlawful killing due to recklessness. \"Assault with intent to kill or to cause serious physical injury is a felony in the jurisdiction.

The homeowner received notice that her uncle had passed away and left her a two-story mansion in a neighboring city. The homeowner decided to move her primary residence to the mansion and rent the ranch-style home. She entered into a one- year written lease agreement with a tenant. The agreement set the monthly rent at $1,000. Shortly after the tenant took possession of the home, he built, at his own expense, a room addition onto the home. The room addition increased the appraised market value of the home from $200,000 to $250,000. At the expiration of the lease, the homeowner informed the tenant that she had decided to sell the home. She offered the tenant the first opportunity to buy the home, but the tenant replied that he could not afford to do so. The tenant did claim that he should be entitled to compensation for the room addition, since it had increased the value of the home, and the homeowner agreed. The tenant and the homeowner then executed the following agreement:\"On the sale of the ranch-style home, the homeowner hereby promises to pay the tenant one- half of any sale proceeds in excess of $200,000, in compensation of the tenant's efforts in constructing the room addition onto the home. In addition, it is hereby agreed that the tenant may remain on the land until the sale is finalized, at a monthly rent of$500. ,'The homeowner initially set the asking price at $250,000, but received no offers to purchase the home. The homeowner decided to reduce the price to $210,000. This price reduction so infuriated the tenant that he thereafter made negative comments about the home to all of the prospective buyers who visited the home. Two months later, the homeowner sold the home to a buyer for $206,000. The buyer had visited the home while the tenant was away on a business trip and therefore did not hear the tenant's negative comments. Thereupon, the tenant, who had paid no rent for the final two months, moved out. After the sale was finalized, the homeowner refused to pay the tenant any of the sale proceeds. Which of the following statements, if true, most persuasively supports the tenant's contention that he is entitled to recover at least $4,000 from the owner (or the equivalent of one-half of the sale proceeds in excess of $200,000, minus two months' unpaid rent at $500 per month)? Choices: a. The owner breached an implied promise by failing to attempt to sell the property at $250,000, which was the appraised market value of the home. , b. Since the tenant made no negative comments about the home to the buyer, there is no showing that the tenant's remarks to the other prospective buyers necessarily caused any loss to the owner (i. e. , prevented her from selling the home for more than $210,000). , c. The agreement between the homeowner that the tenant contained only one express condition (i. e. , the tenant was permitted to remain in the home during the owner's efforts to sell it), and since that condition has occurred, the tenant is entitled to his share of the proceeds from the sale. , d. Even if the tenant's failure to pay any rent for the last two months was a material breach of contract, the owner's promise to pay the tenant a share of the proceeds of the sale was an independent covenant.  Answer:\nb. Since the tenant made no negative comments about the home to the buyer, there is no showing that the tenant's remarks to the other prospective buyers necessarily caused any loss to the owner (i. e. , prevented her from selling the home for more than $210,000). \n\nQuestion: [question] Choices: [choices] Answer: [answer]\nQuestion: A father lived with his son, who was addicted to crack cocaine.

The statute authorized pari-mutuel betting at certain track locations within the state. A seven-member commission was established and empowered to supervise and regulate the sport's activities. Under an inseparable provision of the statute, the commission was authorized to suspend the racing license of any trainer whose horse tested positive for illegal drugs. The statute permitted the commission to make the suspension without any prior hearing. However, suspended trainers were entitled to a prompt post- suspension hearing and decision on any issues in dispute. The racing season was inaugurated at the largest racetrack in the state. The featured race was a $1,000,000 harness race for 2-year-old trotters. After the awards presentation, the winning horse underwent a standard drug test and traces of cocaine were found in his urine sample. Immediately thereafter, the horse was disqualified and the commission suspended the horse's trainer, without a prior hearing. Without seeking a post-suspension hearing as provided by statute, the trainer brings suit in federal district court challenging the constitutionality of the state harness racing law. The statute is probably Choices: a. constitutional, because being granted a racing license is a privilege, not a right. , b. constitutional, because the state's interest in suspending the license of horse trainers suspected of illegal drugging is sufficiently important to permit the suspension of any prior hearing. , c. unconstitutional, because the suspension provision unreasonably interferes with a trainer's right to contract with horse owners and seek gainful employment. , d. unconstitutional, because the suspension provision violates due process by not affording a prior hearing.

In accordance with the new law, all beer consumed within the state must be sold in aluminum cans that are recyclable. There is a provision of the statute that does permit breweries to distribute beer to bars, taverns, and restaurants in kegs for \"on-site\" consumption by patrons. Before the passage of the law, approximately 28% of all beer consumed in the state was packaged in glass bottles.

The statute authorized pari-mutuel betting at certain track locations within the state. A seven-member commission was established and empowered to supervise and regulate the sport's activities. Under an inseparable provision of the statute, the commission was authorized to suspend the racing license of any trainer whose horse tested positive for illegal drugs. The statute permitted the commission to make the suspension without any prior hearing. However, suspended trainers were entitled to a prompt post- suspension hearing and decision on any issues in dispute. The racing season was inaugurated at the largest racetrack in the state. The featured race was a $1,000,000 harness race for 2-year-old trotters. After the awards presentation, the winning horse underwent a standard drug test and traces of cocaine were found in his urine sample. Immediately thereafter, the horse was disqualified and the commission suspended the horse's trainer, without a prior hearing. Without seeking a post-suspension hearing as provided by statute, the trainer brings suit in federal district court challenging the constitutionality of the state harness racing law. The statute is probably Choices: a. constitutional, because being granted a racing license is a privilege, not a right. , b. constitutional, because the state's interest in suspending the license of horse trainers suspected of illegal drugging is sufficiently important to permit the suspension of any prior hearing. , c. unconstitutional, because the suspension provision unreasonably interferes with a trainer's right to contract with horse owners and seek gainful employment. , d. unconstitutional, because the suspension provision violates due process by not affording a prior hearing.

He conducted a small farming operation on the property and grew corn, broccoli, and other vegetables, which he sold to local produce companies. One day, the county police received an anonymous tip that the defendant was growing marijuana on his farm. Acting on this information, in an unmarked vehicle, two undercover police officers then drove to the defendant's farm. They climbed over a chain-link fence and walked around the farm. While surveying the terrain, they came upon a small marijuana patch. The officers then noticed fresh footprints that led from the marijuana patch to a nearby cabin. Believing that marijuana was being stored in the cabin, the police officers decided to immediately secure a search warrant. After obtaining the warrant, they returned to the defendant's farm and entered the cabin. Inside the cabin, the police found a large amount of marijuana that had been recently harvested. The defendant was then arrested and charged with unlawful possession of marijuana.

While Ann was away on a business trip, someone broke into her garage and stole her golf clubs. The next week, Ann was planning to go on vacation and asked Bea if she could borrow her golf clubs. Bea agreed and loaned her golf clubs to Ann, who promised to return them after her vacation. When Ann returned home, she kept the golf clubs and continued to use them. A few weeks later, Bea was having dinner with Carla and learned that Carla owed Ann $4,000. Carla had just been laid off from her job and did not have the money to repay Ann. Bea told Carla that she would contact Ann and make arrangements to repay the loan on her behalf. Thereupon, Ann and Bea entered into a written agreement wherein Bea promised to pay Ann, at a rate of $400 a month, the matured $4,000 debt that Carla owed Ann. In the same written instrument, Ann promised to return Bea's golf clubs, which she still had in her possession. Ann, however, made no written or oral. commitment to forbear to sue Carla to collect the $4,000 debt; and Bea made no oral or written request for any such forbearance. After this agreement between Ann and Bea was signed and executed, Ann promptly returned the golf clubs to Bea. For the next six months, Bea made and Ann accepted the $400 monthly payments as agreed. During that period, Ann, in fact, did forbear to take any legal action against Carla. However, Bea then repudiated her agreement with Ann, and 30 days later Ann filed a contract action against Bea. Assume that the applicable statute of limitations on Ann's antecedent claim against Carla expired the day before Ann filed her contract action against Bea. Which of the following is the most persuasive argument that Bea is not liable to Ann under the terms of their written agreement? Choices: a. Since Ann did not expressly promise to forbear to sue Carla to collect the antecedent $4,000 debt, Ann's forbearance for six months could not constitute consideration for Bea's promise., b. Since the written agreement between Bea and Ann shows a gross imbalance between the values of the promises exchanged, the consideration for Bea's promise was legally insufficient to support it., c.

He has been mulling an idea in his mind to take a lot of money from his employer using his computer skills, and he has worked out a general plan in his mind. Once he obtains the money, he thinks it might be good to let a candle drop and have the whole building burn down. While he is out at lunch, the janitorial staff came through his office. While cleaning the area, one person lit a candle on the man's desk. When they left, he forgot to blow it out. They slammed the door on the way out, causing the lit candle to fall. It started a fire that burned the building down. What crime, if any, is the man most likely to be convicted of? Choices: a.

The statute does not expressly preempt state law. Assume that no other federal statute or administrative regulation addresses the energy efficiency of power equipment. Which of the following is the best argument the state can make for the continued validity of its law?  Choices: a. Congress cannot preempt state laws requiring a specified minimum level of requiring a specified minimum level of fuel efficiency for lawn mowers, because the use of such equipment is a wholly local event and, therefore, is beyond the regulatory authority vested in Congress by the commerce clause., b.

Although it is not the only lake in the county, it is the largest and most scenic, and it attracts visitors from miles around. One of its biggest assets is the excellent fishing and boating, which is available to the public at large. Three years ago, in order to enhance the recreational aspects of the lake, the county leased a sizable portion of the lake and surrounding parkland to a company owned by the most prominent family in the county. The lease required the company to construct and operate a first-rate yacht house and club, complete with bar, restaurant, and private marina, and to pay the county 10% of its net profits as rent. The company set up bylaws, which were reviewed and approved by the county at the time the lease was negotiated. According to the bylaws, the yacht club, complete with its restaurant and bar, would be open to members only, and the membership committee was empowered to set up strict membership \"standards,\" as well as the cost of membership fees and dues. Upon completion of the facilities, the state granted the company a license to sell alcoholic beverages in its restaurant and bar. The membership committee announced that the membership fee was $5,000 and the monthly dues $75. Furthermore, the membership committee had a policy of approving only membership applications from men, while disapproving and denying all applications from women.

A lawyer drove her car to the downtown area to go to a meeting with a client. She was running late for the meeting and could not find a legal parking spot, so she decided to park illegally in front of a fire hydrant. This was in violation of a local ordinance that prohibited parking within 50 feet of a fire hydrant. The lawyer figured that it was better to get a ticket than to miss her meeting with an important client. The spot where she parked was next to the site of the construction of the new building. While the lawyer was at her meeting, an accident occurred at the construction site. A large crane was being used to lift a load of bricks. A cable on the crane broke, and the bricks fell. Most of them landed on top of the lawyer's car. The load of bricks that fell on the lawyer's car caused the gas tank of the car to rupture and explode. Shrapnel from the explosion flew in all directions and injured a pedestrian who was talking on the sidewalk near the lawyer's car. If the pedestrian sues the lawyer and relies on the doctrine of negligence per Se, which of the following, if true, is the lawyer's best defense? Choices: a. Payment of a small fine is the only penalty provided in the ordinance for those who park too close to fire hydrants., b. The police never issued a ticket to the lawyer for parking in front of the fire hydrant., c. The purpose. of the parking ordinance was tofacilitate access to the hydrant by fire trucks,not to protect against accidents like the onethat occurred when bricks fell on the lawyer'scar., d.

The homeowner received notice that her uncle had passed away and left her a two-story mansion in a neighboring city. The homeowner decided to move her primary residence to the mansion and rent the ranch-style home. She entered into a one- year written lease agreement with a tenant. The agreement set the monthly rent at $1,000. Shortly after the tenant took possession of the home, he built, at his own expense, a room addition onto the home. The room addition increased the appraised market value of the home from $200,000 to $250,000. At the expiration of the lease, the homeowner informed the tenant that she had decided to sell the home. She offered the tenant the first opportunity to buy the home, but the tenant replied that he could not afford to do so. The tenant did claim that he should be entitled to compensation for the room addition, since it had increased the value of the home, and the homeowner agreed. The tenant and the homeowner then executed the following agreement:\"On the sale of the ranch-style home, the homeowner hereby promises to pay the tenant one- half of any sale proceeds in excess of $200,000, in compensation of the tenant's efforts in constructing the room addition onto the home. In addition, it is hereby agreed that the tenant may remain on the land until the sale is finalized, at a monthly rent of$500. ,'The homeowner initially set the asking price at $250,000, but received no offers to purchase the home. The homeowner decided to reduce the price to $210,000. This price reduction so infuriated the tenant that he thereafter made negative comments about the home to all of the prospective buyers who visited the home. Two months later, the homeowner sold the home to a buyer for $206,000. The buyer had visited the home while the tenant was away on a business trip and therefore did not hear the tenant's negative comments. Thereupon, the tenant, who had paid no rent for the final two months, moved out. After the sale was finalized, the homeowner refused to pay the tenant any of the sale proceeds. Which of the following statements, if true, most persuasively supports the tenant's contention that he is entitled to recover at least $4,000 from the owner (or the equivalent of one-half of the sale proceeds in excess of $200,000, minus two months' unpaid rent at $500 per month)? Choices: a. The owner breached an implied promise by failing to attempt to sell the property at $250,000, which was the appraised market value of the home. , b. Since the tenant made no negative comments about the home to the buyer, there is no showing that the tenant's remarks to the other prospective buyers necessarily caused any loss to the owner (i. e. , prevented her from selling the home for more than $210,000). , c. The agreement between the homeowner that the tenant contained only one express condition (i. e. , the tenant was permitted to remain in the home during the owner's efforts to sell it), and since that condition has occurred, the tenant is entitled to his share of the proceeds from the sale. , d. Even if the tenant's failure to pay any rent for the last two months was a material breach of contract, the owner's promise to pay the tenant a share of the proceeds of the sale was an independent covenant.  Answer:\nb. Since the tenant made no negative comments about the home to the buyer, there is no showing that the tenant's remarks to the other prospective buyers necessarily caused any loss to the owner (i. e. , prevented her from selling the home for more than $210,000). \n\nQuestion: [question] Choices: [choices] Answer: [answer]\nQuestion: A boyfriend was unhappy in his relationship with his girlfriend. When the girlfriend got drunk, she would become abusive and beat her boyfriend. During the course of their relationship, the beatings became more violent and more frequent.

One night while the girlfriend was asleep, the hit man entered the home with a key given to him by the boyfriend and shot the girlfriend to death. Afterward, the boyfriend was prosecuted for murder as an accomplice. The defense sought to have the judge instruct the jury that the boyfriend acted in self-defense.

No, because the boyfriend could have avoided the danger by safely retreating. , c. Yes, because a reasonable jury could conclude that the boyfriend acted in self-defense by using necessary force to protect himself from the girlfriend's constant violent attacks. , d.

The letter did not say how the writer personally knew that there were drugs or where they were stored. The investigating detective drew up an affidavit of probable cause based on the statements in the letter and presented the request for a search warrant and the affidavit to a magistrate judge. The magistrate judge signed a search warrant based on the affidavit. The police raided the home and found several pounds of cocaine in the basement. The defendants filed a motion to suppress the evidence based on insufficient cause to issue a warrant. The state courts rejected the suppression motion. What would the U.S. Supreme Court most likely decide? Choices: a. The Court would validate the search warrant because there were sufficient detailed allegations in the letter to justify a probable cause finding., b. The Court would invalidate the warrant because there was insufficient information and no corroboration to support the credibility and personal knowledge of the informant., c. The warrant was valid because when the informant's information turns out to be true after the warrant is issued and executed, then that validates the affidavit of probable cause., d. The warrant was invalid because affidavits of probable cause must give the name and address of the informant; an affidavit cannot be based on an anonymous informant. Answer:\nb.

The statute authorized pari-mutuel betting at certain track locations within the state. A seven-member commission was established and empowered to supervise and regulate the sport's activities. Under an inseparable provision of the statute, the commission was authorized to suspend the racing license of any trainer whose horse tested positive for illegal drugs. The statute permitted the commission to make the suspension without any prior hearing. However, suspended trainers were entitled to a prompt post- suspension hearing and decision on any issues in dispute. The racing season was inaugurated at the largest racetrack in the state. The featured race was a $1,000,000 harness race for 2-year-old trotters. After the awards presentation, the winning horse underwent a standard drug test and traces of cocaine were found in his urine sample. Immediately thereafter, the horse was disqualified and the commission suspended the horse's trainer, without a prior hearing. Without seeking a post-suspension hearing as provided by statute, the trainer brings suit in federal district court challenging the constitutionality of the state harness racing law. The statute is probably Choices: a. constitutional, because being granted a racing license is a privilege, not a right. , b. constitutional, because the state's interest in suspending the license of horse trainers suspected of illegal drugging is sufficiently important to permit the suspension of any prior hearing. , c. unconstitutional, because the suspension provision unreasonably interferes with a trainer's right to contract with horse owners and seek gainful employment. , d. unconstitutional, because the suspension provision violates due process by not affording a prior hearing.

The treaty, which was ratified by the Senate, was supported by professional baseball and hockey players. Many Canadian hockey players, who were employed by American teams and lived in the United States during the hockey season, lobbied for passage of the treaty, since they were subject to the payment of both U. S. and Canadian income taxes. In like manner, many American baseball players, who lived in Canada during the baseball season, objected to the same dual taxation. In violation of the treaty, a Canadian court convicted a U. S. citizen who resided in Canada, of illegally evading the payment of Canadian income taxes. The U. S. citizen, who was a member of a Canadian baseball team, resided in Canada during the baseball season. Following his conviction, the President announced that the previously effective tax treaty would no longer be abided by the United States. The President proclaimed that Canada's refusal to honor the treaty rendered it invalid. As a result, the President ordered the Internal Revenue Service to begin collecting income taxes from Canadian citizens residing in the United States in the same manner that it collects taxes from other residents of this country. A Canadian citizen and resident of the United States, sues in an appropriate federal court, seeking a declaratory judgment that the treaty with Canada remains valid and effective. Therefore, he contends that the Internal Revenue Service may not collect U. S. income taxes from him. Which of the following is the strongest constitutional basis that may be urged in support of this claim? Choices: a.

When she arrived, the graduate was told that her job was contingent on passing the state bar examination, which was being offered in July. In preparing for the bar examination, the graduate planned to take a bar review course. Although she had not pre-enrolled, the graduate planned to attend and pay for the course at registration. On the morning the course was set to begin, the graduate arrived late after getting stuck in freeway traffic. By the time the graduate got to the course location, registration had already been completed. When the graduate looked into the room where the course was being conducted, she saw the lecture had begun, and everyone was inside busily taking notes. Panicky, the graduate picked up a set of course materials that were lying on the registration table and entered without paying. Although the graduate intended to pay the enrollment fee, no one was at the registration table to take her money. After attending the first couple of classes, the graduate sent a cashier's check for the full amount of the enrollment fee to the bar review company. Unbeknownst to the graduate, the bar review course's regional director noticed that she had entered the lectures without paying. After ascertaining her identity from a fellow student who knew the graduate, the company filed a complaint with the local prosecutor, and a warrant was issued for her arrest. The complaint charged the graduate with the crime of larceny by trick, for deliberately failing to pay for services rendered. After the complaint was issued, the graduate's check arrived at the company's office. The company deposited the check but failed to inform the prosecutor that payment had been received. The graduate was arrested and held in custody overnight before the matter was resolved. The graduate suffered severe emotional distress at the publicity she received in the local newspapers and the humiliation she suffered for being arrested and held in police custody.

Some years prior to her death, she conveyed a deed in fee simple to her oldest son. After her death, her youngest son filed a claim against the estate contending that the father's will devised only a life estate to his wife. A state statute said that a fee simple would be presumed where the intent of the testator did not clearly show an intent to devise a lesser estate.

On behalf of his company, he borrowed $500,000 from a credit union for this purpose. The company was to repay the loan at the rate of $2,500 per month. The loan was secured by a mortgage on the building that housed the company's operation center. Eight months later, the company's sales started to drop and the company began experiencing cash flow problems. As a result, the company failed to make its loan payments for three consecutive months, causing the credit union to threaten to foreclose on the mortgage. The president's father, a retired wealthy investor, then intervened on behalf of the company, paid the three missed loan payments, and told the credit union that if they would refrain from any legal action against the company for a year, he would personally see that the debt was paid. The credit union orally agreed to the father's surety arrangement. However, it was never reduced to writing. Six months later, the company once again missed consecutive payments, and the credit union filed a foreclosure suit against the company.

It is the circus's practice to finish each day's entertainment by discharging a so-called aerial bomb into the sky. After exploding, the aerial bomb emits a spectacular rainbow fireworks display that is seen for miles around. One afternoon, a 10-year-old boy and a few friends went to the fairgrounds to see the circus. After paying their admission, they were about to enter the \"big top\" when the boy came upon an aerial bomb lying on the ground. Ignorant of what the object really was, but in an exploratory mood, the boy applied a match to the fuse of the fireworks device. It exploded and seriously injured the boy. After the accident, and before the parents of the boy had retained a lawyer, the adjuster for the circus's insurance carrier contacted the parents several times, trying to negotiate a settlement of their claim against the circus. On each occasion, the adjuster told the parents there was no need for them to hire an attorney because the applicable civil code did not provide for recovery in such a situation. The adjuster was aware that this information was blatantly false. He also warned the parents that unless they accepted his offered settlement of $5,000, they would receive nothing. For over a month, the adjuster continued to harass the parents. Outraged by the adjuster's actions, the parents sought the advice of a neighbor who recommended that they consult an attorney. The parents went ahead and retained a lawyer who subsequently negotiated a $250,000 settlement with the adjuster's insurance company for the claims relating to the boy's injury from the aerial bomb.

The position of state trooper is filled on the basis of competitive examinations taken by all of the applicants. After the resident alien applied for the position, the state authorities refused him permission to take the qualifying examination. The state authorities based their refusal on state statute, which provided:\"No person shall become a member of the state police unless he/she shall be a citizen of the United States. \"Thus, under this provision, as a prerequisite to becoming a member of the state police, an alien must relinquish his foreign citizenship and become a citizen.

In recent years, many outside organizations have entered the fairgrounds and distributed literature and paraphernalia to the many thousands of patrons visiting the fair. State fair officials did not endorse any of these organizations but permitted them to disseminate their materials throughout the fairgrounds without charge. Lately, however, many families attending the fair have complained about being harassed by canvassers from these various organizations. In an effort to protect the safety and welfare of the persons visiting the fair, the state legislature enacted a law prohibiting anyone from selling or distributing materials at the state fair. This new statute provided, however, that groups could pay a $50 license fee and distribute their literature from enclosed booths. These booths would be set up along the entrance to the fairgrounds and rented to anyone wishing to sell or distribute materials or soliciting money during the fair. The first year that the statute went into effect, approximately 40 groups rented booth space. There were various organizations paying the $50 license fee. A group of scientists opposed to the use of aerosol spray cans, requested permission to distribute literature at the fairgrounds. The scientists claimed that they simply wanted to warn people of the perils created by the disintegration of the ozone layer from the dispersion of fluorocarbons into the atmosphere. State fair officials offered to lease the scientists a booth at the $50 fee, but refused to permit solicitation activities outside the booth enclosures. The scientists were unwilling to pay the $50 license fee and instituted suit in state court seeking a court order permitting them to distribute literature anywhere in the fairgrounds area. Which of the following is the strongest argument insupport of the constitutionality of the statute? Choices: a. The statute applies to the limited area of the state-owned fairgrounds, and does not discriminate among the various organizations by way of their political, religious, or commercial viewpoints., b. The statute applies to representatives of popular organizations, as well as to representatives of unpopular organizations, and is a democratic expression of the will of the people because it was adopted by the state legislature., c. The statute is necessary to protect the safety and welfare of persons using a state facility, and does not discriminate among diverse viewpoints since there is an alternative means by which these organizations can reach their audience., d. The statute protects the patrons of a public facility against unwanted invasions of their privacy by restricting the solicitation activities of those organizations that the patrons do not support.

The plant had been shut down for 10 years. Much to Darlene's chagrin, officials at the plant had announced plans to reopen the plant. Darlene, who was a waitress at a local restaurant, devised a scheme whereby she would contaminate oysters at her restaurant with small amounts of a poisonous substance. Although she didn't want to seriously injure anyone, Darlene believed that if some people got sick from eating the oysters, they would attribute their illness to nuclear waste from the power plant. To facilitate her plan, she stole some poison from a local pharmacy. She sprinkled it on some oysters at the restaurant where she worked. Mistakenly, she put too much of the poison on some of the oysters. A few of the customers who ate the oysters became sick and nauseated. One person suffered convulsions and died from the poisoning. A statute in the jurisdiction provides: \"Any intentional and premeditated killing, or one occurring during the perpetration of a felony, is murder in the first degree. Murder in the second degree is murder with intent to cause serious bodily harm. Manslaughter is an unlawful killing due to recklessness. \"Assault with intent to kill or to cause serious physical injury is a felony in the jurisdiction.

In accordance with the new law, all beer consumed within the state must be sold in aluminum cans that are recyclable. There is a provision of the statute that does permit breweries to distribute beer to bars, taverns, and restaurants in kegs for \"on-site\" consumption by patrons.

Of that total, 75% of the beer was bottled outside the state, while 25% was bottled by companies in-state. The legislature passed the law at the strong urging of the aluminum can industry. It was estimated that one aluminum company alone spent over $5,000,000 in its lobbying campaign for the passage of the bill.

Due to the precipitous drop in oil prices, many oil companies have been forced to cut back on oil production and lay off many workers. As a result, unemployment has reached all-time high levels in several states. In order to alleviate this potentially catastrophic situation, the one of those state's legislatures recently enacted a statute requiring that 10% of all oil produced within the state be purchased by the state and reserved for use by state residents. The purpose of the statute was twofold: (1) it was intended to stimulate the oil industry within the state by encouraging more production and exploration, and (2) it was designed to create an oil reserve so that state residents and industries would not suffer unduly from future oil shortages. Subsequently, Congress enacted a statute forbidding states to reserve local resources for local use in this manner. Is this state statute constitutional? Choices: a. Yes, because Congress has not expressly forbidden states to reserve local resources for local use. , b. Yes, because the state statute requires that the oil be used for the general welfare of the people in emergency situations. , c.

The man\u00d5s family then rented an apartment and demanded that the city pay the rent for that temporary residence. The family relied on a state law providing that any person who was dispossessed of his or her place of residence because of the actions of city officials was entitled to replacement housing at the city\u00d5s expense until permanent substitute housing could be found. When the city refused to pay the rent for the apartment, the man\u00d5s family sued the city in a state trial court claiming a right to such payment under both the state law and the due process clause of the Fourteenth Amendment to the United States Constitution. The highest state court ruled for the family. Although the court decided that the family had no right to payment under the state law, it held that the Fourteenth Amendment entitled the family to payment of the rent for the temporary apart-ment. In its opinion, the highest state court indicated that in several of its decisions it had found cities liable for compen-sation in similar situations on the basis of the due process clause of the state constitution.

On the evening of June 29, the spinster, disguising her voice, called the spa and told the businessman, \"You pimp, why don't you take your dirty trade elsewhere?\" Without paying any attention to the call, the businessman hung up. The spinster then began making repeated crank telephone calls to the businessman's establishment. Every hour on the hour for the next three weeks, the spinster made her crank calls, harassing the businessman and his employees. As a result of the hourly phone calls, spa business was constantly disrupted, causing the businessman to suffer a decline in the volume of customers. After contacting the police, the businessman discovered that the spinster was the person making the harassing calls. If the businessman asserts a claim against the spinster, the theory on which he will most likely prevail is Choices: a. public nuisance., b. private nuisance., c. intentional infliction of emotional distress., d. negligence.

In accordance with the new law, all beer consumed within the state must be sold in aluminum cans that are recyclable. There is a provision of the statute that does permit breweries to distribute beer to bars, taverns, and restaurants in kegs for \"on-site\" consumption by patrons. Before the passage of the law, approximately 28% of all beer consumed in the state was packaged in glass bottles. Of that total, 75% of the beer was bottled outside the state, while 25% was bottled by companies in-state. The legislature passed the law at the strong urging of the aluminum can industry. It was estimated that one aluminum company alone spent over $5,000,000 in its lobbying campaign for the passage of the bill.

Located below the ranch is a 40-acre farm that is owned by a farmer. There is a stream, which is a non-navigable watercourse, that originates at the top of the mountain and runs all the way down into the valley below. Both the ranch and the farm are within the watershed of the stream. When the farmer purchased the farm in 1974, he began taking water from the stream and used it to irrigate the southern half of his property which he has used as a farm. Prior to 1974, the southern half of the farm had been cleared and placed in cultivation, while the northern half remained wooded and unused except for an occasional hike or gathering of timber for use as domestic fuel. The farmer continued this established pattern of use. Now (January 2010), he is still taking water from the stream and using it to irrigate the southern half of the farm. In 2008, the rancher built a home on the ranch and began taking water from the stream for domestic purposes. During that year there was heavy rainfall, and this caused the stream to run down the mountain at a high water level. The next year, however, there was a drought. As a result, the stream flowed at a very low level. Consequently, there was only enough water to irrigate the farmer's farmland or, in the alternative, to supply all of the rancher's domestic water needs and one quarter of the farmer's irrigation requirements. The mountain is located in a jurisdiction where the period of prescription is 15 years. Inasmuch as the stream is still flowing at a very low level and the rancher is continuing to take water for his personal needs, there is insufficient water to irrigate the farm. As a consequence, the farmer brings an appropriate action to declare that his water rights to the stream are superior to those of the rancher. In addition, the farmer moves to have the full flow of the stream passed to him, notwithstanding the effect it might have on the rancher. If this state follows the doctrine of prior appropriation, judgment should be for whom? Choices: a. The rancher, because as an upstream landowner, he would have superior rights to the water than a downstream owner., b. The rancher, because domestic use is superior to and protected against an agricultural use., c. The farmer, because he has obtained an easement by prescription to remove as much water as he may need., d. The farmer, because he has put the water to a beneficial use prior to the rancher's use and has continuously used the water. Answer:\n", "Result": "d.

Some years prior to her death, she conveyed a deed in fee simple to her oldest son. After her death, her youngest son filed a claim against the estate contending that the father's will devised only a life estate to his wife. A state statute said that a fee simple would be presumed where the intent of the testator did not clearly show an intent to devise a lesser estate. The lower court held that the widow had received a defeasible fee conditioned on her remaining a widow.

Due to the precipitous drop in oil prices, many oil companies have been forced to cut back on oil production and lay off many workers. As a result, unemployment has reached all-time high levels in several states. In order to alleviate this potentially catastrophic situation, the one of those state's legislatures recently enacted a statute requiring that 10% of all oil produced within the state be purchased by the state and reserved for use by state residents. The purpose of the statute was twofold: (1) it was intended to stimulate the oil industry within the state by encouraging more production and exploration, and (2) it was designed to create an oil reserve so that state residents and industries would not suffer unduly from future oil shortages. Subsequently, Congress enacted a statute forbidding states to reserve local resources for local use in this manner. Is this state statute constitutional? Choices: a. Yes, because Congress has not expressly forbidden states to reserve local resources for local use. , b. Yes, because the state statute requires that the oil be used for the general welfare of the people in emergency situations. , c. No, because a state may not protect its residents from out-of-state competition for its natural resources without the express permission of Congress. , d. No, because application of the statute denies non-oil producing companies to equal protection of the law, in violation of the Fourteenth Amendment.  Answer:\nc.

The plant had been shut down for 10 years. Much to Darlene's chagrin, officials at the plant had announced plans to reopen the plant. Darlene, who was a waitress at a local restaurant, devised a scheme whereby she would contaminate oysters at her restaurant with small amounts of a poisonous substance. Although she didn't want to seriously injure anyone, Darlene believed that if some people got sick from eating the oysters, they would attribute their illness to nuclear waste from the power plant. To facilitate her plan, she stole some poison from a local pharmacy. She sprinkled it on some oysters at the restaurant where she worked. Mistakenly, she put too much of the poison on some of the oysters. A few of the customers who ate the oysters became sick and nauseated. One person suffered convulsions and died from the poisoning. A statute in the jurisdiction provides: \"Any intentional and premeditated killing, or one occurring during the perpetration of a felony, is murder in the first degree. Murder in the second degree is murder with intent to cause serious bodily harm.

A new federal statute requires all power equipment, including lawn mowers, to be labeled with energy efficiency stickers to permit purchasers to make informed choices when buying such equipment. The statute does not expressly preempt state law. Assume that no other federal statute or administrative regulation addresses the energy efficiency of power equipment. Which of the following is the best argument the state can make for the continued validity of its law?  Choices: a. Congress cannot preempt state laws requiring a specified minimum level of requiring a specified minimum level of fuel efficiency for lawn mowers, because the use of such equipment is a wholly local event and, therefore, is beyond the regulatory authority vested in Congress by the commerce clause., b. The law is unaffected by the federal statute, because Congress did not expressly prohibit state laws requiring power equipment to meet specified levels of fuel efficiency., c. The purpose of the law is consistent with the purpose of the federal statute, enforcement of the law would not interfere with the full execution of the statute, and there is no evidence that Congress intended to preclude the states from enacting supplemental laws on this subject., d.

The statute authorized pari-mutuel betting at certain track locations within the state. A seven-member commission was established and empowered to supervise and regulate the sport's activities. Under an inseparable provision of the statute, the commission was authorized to suspend the racing license of any trainer whose horse tested positive for illegal drugs. The statute permitted the commission to make the suspension without any prior hearing. However, suspended trainers were entitled to a prompt post- suspension hearing and decision on any issues in dispute. The racing season was inaugurated at the largest racetrack in the state. The featured race was a $1,000,000 harness race for 2-year-old trotters. After the awards presentation, the winning horse underwent a standard drug test and traces of cocaine were found in his urine sample. Immediately thereafter, the horse was disqualified and the commission suspended the horse's trainer, without a prior hearing. Without seeking a post-suspension hearing as provided by statute, the trainer brings suit in federal district court challenging the constitutionality of the state harness racing law. The statute is probably Choices: a. constitutional, because being granted a racing license is a privilege, not a right. , b. constitutional, because the state's interest in suspending the license of horse trainers suspected of illegal drugging is sufficiently important to permit the suspension of any prior hearing. , c. unconstitutional, because the suspension provision unreasonably interferes with a trainer's right to contract with horse owners and seek gainful employment. , d. unconstitutional, because the suspension provision violates due process by not affording a prior hearing.

The homeowner received notice that her uncle had passed away and left her a two-story mansion in a neighboring city. The homeowner decided to move her primary residence to the mansion and rent the ranch-style home. She entered into a one- year written lease agreement with a tenant. The agreement set the monthly rent at $1,000. Shortly after the tenant took possession of the home, he built, at his own expense, a room addition onto the home. The room addition increased the appraised market value of the home from $200,000 to $250,000. At the expiration of the lease, the homeowner informed the tenant that she had decided to sell the home. She offered the tenant the first opportunity to buy the home, but the tenant replied that he could not afford to do so. The tenant did claim that he should be entitled to compensation for the room addition, since it had increased the value of the home, and the homeowner agreed. The tenant and the homeowner then executed the following agreement:\"On the sale of the ranch-style home, the homeowner hereby promises to pay the tenant one- half of any sale proceeds in excess of $200,000, in compensation of the tenant's efforts in constructing the room addition onto the home. In addition, it is hereby agreed that the tenant may remain on the land until the sale is finalized, at a monthly rent of$500. ,'The homeowner initially set the asking price at $250,000, but received no offers to purchase the home. The homeowner decided to reduce the price to $210,000. This price reduction so infuriated the tenant that he thereafter made negative comments about the home to all of the prospective buyers who visited the home. Two months later, the homeowner sold the home to a buyer for $206,000. The buyer had visited the home while the tenant was away on a business trip and therefore did not hear the tenant's negative comments. Thereupon, the tenant, who had paid no rent for the final two months, moved out. After the sale was finalized, the homeowner refused to pay the tenant any of the sale proceeds. Which of the following statements, if true, most persuasively supports the tenant's contention that he is entitled to recover at least $4,000 from the owner (or the equivalent of one-half of the sale proceeds in excess of $200,000, minus two months' unpaid rent at $500 per month)? Choices: a. The owner breached an implied promise by failing to attempt to sell the property at $250,000, which was the appraised market value of the home. , b. Since the tenant made no negative comments about the home to the buyer, there is no showing that the tenant's remarks to the other prospective buyers necessarily caused any loss to the owner (i. e. , prevented her from selling the home for more than $210,000). , c. The agreement between the homeowner that the tenant contained only one express condition (i. e. , the tenant was permitted to remain in the home during the owner's efforts to sell it), and since that condition has occurred, the tenant is entitled to his share of the proceeds from the sale. , d. Even if the tenant's failure to pay any rent for the last two months was a material breach of contract, the owner's promise to pay the tenant a share of the proceeds of the sale was an independent covenant.  Answer:\nb.

The loan was secured by a mortgage on the building that housed the company's operation center. Eight months later, the company's sales started to drop and the company began experiencing cash flow problems. As a result, the company failed to make its loan payments for three consecutive months, causing the credit union to threaten to foreclose on the mortgage.

The credit union orally agreed to the father's surety arrangement. However, it was never reduced to writing. Six months later, the company once again missed consecutive payments, and the credit union filed a foreclosure suit against the company.

Darlene, who was a waitress at a local restaurant, devised a scheme whereby she would contaminate oysters at her restaurant with small amounts of a poisonous substance. Although she didn't want to seriously injure anyone, Darlene believed that if some people got sick from eating the oysters, they would attribute their illness to nuclear waste from the power plant.

A downward slope exists from the homeowner's land to the sister's land. The homeowner's and daughter's lots were in an unimproved natural state. The sister, however, had lived for 10 years in a house that she had built on her property. The daughter, in preparation for building a house on her lot, carefully excavated an area eight feet deep for the purpose of building a basement. The daughter completed construction of her house and macadamized an area for use as a driveway without changing the former contours of the land. Shortly thereafter, the sister began to make complaints to the daughter about the flooding of her basement, which she claimed had been previously free of water. The sister then built a concrete wall three feet along her border with the daughter to prevent the flow of rain water running onto her land from the daughter's property.

Several years later, at a time when the woman still owed the bank $750,000 on the mortgage loan, she sold the farm to a man for $900,000. The man paid the woman $150,000 in cash and specifically assumed the mortgage note. The bank received notice of this transaction and elected not to exer-cise the optional due-on-sale clause in the mortgage. Without informing the man, the bank later released the woman from any further personal liability on the note. After he had owned the farm for a number of years, the man defaulted on the loan. The bank properly accelerated the loan, and the farm was eventually sold at a foreclosure sale for $500,000.

The homeowner received notice that her uncle had passed away and left her a two-story mansion in a neighboring city. The homeowner decided to move her primary residence to the mansion and rent the ranch-style home. She entered into a one- year written lease agreement with a tenant. The agreement set the monthly rent at $1,000. Shortly after the tenant took possession of the home, he built, at his own expense, a room addition onto the home. The room addition increased the appraised market value of the home from $200,000 to $250,000. At the expiration of the lease, the homeowner informed the tenant that she had decided to sell the home. She offered the tenant the first opportunity to buy the home, but the tenant replied that he could not afford to do so. The tenant did claim that he should be entitled to compensation for the room addition, since it had increased the value of the home, and the homeowner agreed. The tenant and the homeowner then executed the following agreement:\"On the sale of the ranch-style home, the homeowner hereby promises to pay the tenant one- half of any sale proceeds in excess of $200,000, in compensation of the tenant's efforts in constructing the room addition onto the home. In addition, it is hereby agreed that the tenant may remain on the land until the sale is finalized, at a monthly rent of$500. ,'The homeowner initially set the asking price at $250,000, but received no offers to purchase the home. The homeowner decided to reduce the price to $210,000. This price reduction so infuriated the tenant that he thereafter made negative comments about the home to all of the prospective buyers who visited the home. Two months later, the homeowner sold the home to a buyer for $206,000. The buyer had visited the home while the tenant was away on a business trip and therefore did not hear the tenant's negative comments. Thereupon, the tenant, who had paid no rent for the final two months, moved out. After the sale was finalized, the homeowner refused to pay the tenant any of the sale proceeds. Which of the following statements, if true, most persuasively supports the tenant's contention that he is entitled to recover at least $4,000 from the owner (or the equivalent of one-half of the sale proceeds in excess of $200,000, minus two months' unpaid rent at $500 per month)? Choices: a. The owner breached an implied promise by failing to attempt to sell the property at $250,000, which was the appraised market value of the home. , b. Since the tenant made no negative comments about the home to the buyer, there is no showing that the tenant's remarks to the other prospective buyers necessarily caused any loss to the owner (i. e. , prevented her from selling the home for more than $210,000). , c. The agreement between the homeowner that the tenant contained only one express condition (i. e. , the tenant was permitted to remain in the home during the owner's efforts to sell it), and since that condition has occurred, the tenant is entitled to his share of the proceeds from the sale. , d. Even if the tenant's failure to pay any rent for the last two months was a material breach of contract, the owner's promise to pay the tenant a share of the proceeds of the sale was an independent covenant.  Answer:\nb. Since the tenant made no negative comments about the home to the buyer, there is no showing that the tenant's remarks to the other prospective buyers necessarily caused any loss to the owner (i. e. , prevented her from selling the home for more than $210,000). \n\nQuestion: [question] Choices: [choices] Answer: [answer]\nQuestion: A tenant lived in a small apartment building that was owned by a landlord.
