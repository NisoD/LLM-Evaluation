Which of the following statements is false? Choices: A. For random effects models, the use of OLS would result in consistent but inefficient parameter estimation, B. If the Hausman test is not satisfied, the random effects model is more appropriate., C. Random effects estimation involves the construction of \"quasi-demeaned\" data, D.
