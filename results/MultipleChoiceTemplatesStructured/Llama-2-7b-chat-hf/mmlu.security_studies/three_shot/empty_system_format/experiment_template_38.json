Choices: 1. The Chemical Weapons Convention (CWC) prohibited the possession or deployment of chemical weapons; however it failed to implement stipulations that would require signatories to declare their existing stocks of chemical weapons, to identify facilities that were once involved in chemical production, or to announce when their existing stocks would be destroyed. OR 2. The CWC made some important developments regarding the use and possession of chemical weapons and the destruction of existing stockpiles. However, the treaty failed to establish an independent body empowered with the capacity to check treaty compliance. Lack of supra-state authority has undermined the ability to enforce those developments. Given the anarchical nature of international society it may be in the national security interest to retain stocks. OR 3. Chemical weapons continue to exert a determining influence on international society. As early as the 1970s military strategists were convinced of the deterrence effects chemical weapons could have, comparable to the second strike survival logic of nuclear deterrence. The preferences of strategists resulted in continued manufacture and stockpiling of weapons creating an international crisis of stability. OR 4. While the CWC has been ratified by the majority of international society, some nations with a large chemical capability at their disposal have yet to enter into the treaty. However, to some analysts the destructive military potential would be limited, having a moderate effect on a well-equipped army in conventional warfare. Chemical arsenal essentially falls under the category of the \"poor mans\" weaponry, being simplistic and inexpensive whilst having limited military utility. However, the concern remains of the prospective impact a terrorist chemical attack could have on civilian populations. Answer:\n4.

Choices: 1. The global economy is interconnected, ensuring that energy security for one is dependent upon energy security for all. Thus all core powers have the same interests in maintaining and extending the conditions under which this market operates. As long as this economic order exists, conflict between major powers over energy reserves is highly unlikely. OR 2. Energy scarcity is likely to lead to future disruptions in the global system and the emergence of a 'new international energy order', characterized less by liberal free-market trading than by statism and neo-mercantilism. OR 3. Oil remains the lifeblood of the current order - an order that is based upon an unequal (and deeply unjust) distribution of wealth and power in favour of capitalist economic elites. Those who benefit most from the prevailing order will ensure that the flow of energy under favourable conditions continues to underpin their position in the global system. OR 4.

Choices: 1. Although trends suggest that terrorism shows little sign of abating there is some positive indication that international cooperation between countries will play an increasingly important role in collaboration with indigenous intelligence agencies. A meaningful international definition of terrorism would provide a useful framework for responding to the spectre of terrorism. OR 2. Responding to terrorism solely in its manifest form (the war on terror and crime approaches) holds little potential for eradicating terrorism in the long-term.

Bloody and violent conflict between social forces is not consistent with the presence of the centralizing force with the capacity to attain monopoly of control over violence. OR 2. The utility of explaining weak state insecurity with a comparison to the historical conditions of state consolidation in Europe does not stand in the contemporary context of global society because of the pervasion of international norms to prevent violent conflict from manifesting in the consolidation process.

Environmental change would have a negative impact if resources were available to adapt to environmental change to sustain their existing income levels. OR 3. In terms of the social determinants of insecurity, environmental change does not undermine human security in isolation; larger scale processes affect people's sensitivity to environmental changes and their capacity to adapt, whilst past processes shape present insecurities and ongoing processes shape future insecurities.

The Chemical Weapons Convention (CWC) prohibited the possession or deployment of chemical weapons; however it failed to implement stipulations that would require signatories to declare their existing stocks of chemical weapons, to identify facilities that were once involved in chemical production, or to announce when their existing stocks would be destroyed. OR 2. The CWC made some important developments regarding the use and possession of chemical weapons and the destruction of existing stockpiles. However, the treaty failed to establish an independent body empowered with the capacity to check treaty compliance. Lack of supra-state authority has undermined the ability to enforce those developments. Given the anarchical nature of international society it may be in the national security interest to retain stocks. OR 3. Chemical weapons continue to exert a determining influence on international society. As early as the 1970s military strategists were convinced of the deterrence effects chemical weapons could have, comparable to the second strike survival logic of nuclear deterrence. The preferences of strategists resulted in continued manufacture and stockpiling of weapons creating an international crisis of stability. OR 4. While the CWC has been ratified by the majority of international society, some nations with a large chemical capability at their disposal have yet to enter into the treaty. However, to some analysts the destructive military potential would be limited, having a moderate effect on a well-equipped army in conventional warfare. Chemical arsenal essentially falls under the category of the \"poor mans\" weaponry, being simplistic and inexpensive whilst having limited military utility. However, the concern remains of the prospective impact a terrorist chemical attack could have on civilian populations. Answer:\n4.

Choices: 1. There is a developing scholarly trend toward proliferation pessimism, a pattern which has gained momentum rather than subsided with the end of the Cold War. There is concern that accidental war may occur, either through misperception, psychological or technical problems that can lead to spiralling tensions which result in a failure of deterrence policy. In addition, normal accidents resulting from the inability of a state to capably anticipate human-machine interactions in the complexities of the international (and anarchical) system may also occur. OR 2. Proliferation optimists dispute the claim that nuclear technology leads to a propensity of the holding actor towards war. They do concede that there is the risk that terrorists acquiring the weapon could create an existential threat to the international system, although the threat is not yet a reality. Furthermore, the ability to retaliate can eliminate an opponent's potential gain. OR 3. Despite the recognition that the ability to retaliate (the secure second-strike capability) produces a situation known as crisis stability, there is no consensus on the impact of nuclear capabilities, whether a source of stabilization or an existential threat. However there is agreement that the spread of WMD capacity to non-state actors would be fundamentally detrimental to international security based on the recognition that existing deterrence strategies and capabilities do not address the use of nuclear weapons. Indeed whilst the possibility exists, states will have to heighten security efforts. OR 4. Deterrence has proved to have been a source of stabilization during the Cold War but proliferation pessimists contend that new states' development programs do not provide sufficient guarantees that the state sponsors will act as good custodians. Weak state structures might result in sabotage, accidental use, or even theft. There is also the problem of states developing technology under the guise of deterrence whilst having ulterior motives.

Environmental change would have a negative impact if resources were available to adapt to environmental change to sustain their existing income levels. OR 3.

OR 2. The CWC made some important developments regarding the use and possession of chemical weapons and the destruction of existing stockpiles. However, the treaty failed to establish an independent body empowered with the capacity to check treaty compliance. Lack of supra-state authority has undermined the ability to enforce those developments. Given the anarchical nature of international society it may be in the national security interest to retain stocks. OR 3. Chemical weapons continue to exert a determining influence on international society.

Possession of WMD may act as a deterrence to stronger opponents against potential threat, or be used to defeat their adversaries if engaged in combat. WMD capabilities may also be developed to gain automatic status and diplomatic influence amongst the international community. OR 2. Although there are fears posed by WMD proliferation that terrorists may gain the capacity to develop weapons, it would remain very difficult to construct even a primitive gun-type nuclear weapon. However, whilst nuclear capabilities may be elusive, international or domestic terrorist networks may have the resources to construct and use chemical, biological, and radiological weapons. OR 3. WMD vary vastly in terms of their availability, lethality, and destructive potential and the ease with which they can be manufactured. This means that the potential threats posed by each type of weapon are different. High yield, lightweight nuclear weapons use cutting-edge technology, whilst some chemical and biological weapons have been available for a long time.

Choices: 1. The Chemical Weapons Convention (CWC) prohibited the possession or deployment of chemical weapons; however it failed to implement stipulations that would require signatories to declare their existing stocks of chemical weapons, to identify facilities that were once involved in chemical production, or to announce when their existing stocks would be destroyed. OR 2. The CWC made some important developments regarding the use and possession of chemical weapons and the destruction of existing stockpiles. However, the treaty failed to establish an independent body empowered with the capacity to check treaty compliance. Lack of supra-state authority has undermined the ability to enforce those developments. Given the anarchical nature of international society it may be in the national security interest to retain stocks. OR 3. Chemical weapons continue to exert a determining influence on international society. As early as the 1970s military strategists were convinced of the deterrence effects chemical weapons could have, comparable to the second strike survival logic of nuclear deterrence. The preferences of strategists resulted in continued manufacture and stockpiling of weapons creating an international crisis of stability. OR 4. While the CWC has been ratified by the majority of international society, some nations with a large chemical capability at their disposal have yet to enter into the treaty. However, to some analysts the destructive military potential would be limited, having a moderate effect on a well-equipped army in conventional warfare. Chemical arsenal essentially falls under the category of the \"poor mans\" weaponry, being simplistic and inexpensive whilst having limited military utility. However, the concern remains of the prospective impact a terrorist chemical attack could have on civilian populations. Answer:\n4.

Choices: 1. Although trends suggest that terrorism shows little sign of abating there is some positive indication that international cooperation between countries will play an increasingly important role in collaboration with indigenous intelligence agencies. A meaningful international definition of terrorism would provide a useful framework for responding to the spectre of terrorism. OR 2. Responding to terrorism solely in its manifest form (the war on terror and crime approaches) holds little potential for eradicating terrorism in the long-term. It is clear that terrorism will remain a security threat for years to come unless the root causes are addressed. Countermeasures will prove fruitless (or a perpetual fight) unless nascent discontent is addressed before it is radicalized. OR 3. All of these options. OR 4. A concern with counter-terrorism efforts is the potential consequences on civil liberties. The greatest danger comes when governments regard the battle against terrorism as warfare because most democratic countries permit greater restrictions on the rights of individuals during wartime. As a consequence, viewing the struggle as 'war' tends to have connotations with the idea that temporary personal curtailment may be a necessity for long-term victory. Answer:\n3.

Human insecurity is an interchangeable concept with environmental insecurity; environmental change invariably undermines human security because its impact is always 'human' and acts as a constraining or facilitating factor that determines the extent of human development. Environmental change and conditions will therefore be the primary determinant of a person's or community's capacity to adapt to their surroundings. OR 2. The ways in which environmental change can threaten the welfare of the international system is dependent on the extensity of poverty as the key variable determining a population's reactive capability. Environmental change would have a negative impact if resources were available to adapt to environmental change to sustain their existing income levels. OR 3. In terms of the social determinants of insecurity, environmental change does not undermine human security in isolation; larger scale processes affect people's sensitivity to environmental changes and their capacity to adapt, whilst past processes shape present insecurities and ongoing processes shape future insecurities. OR 4. The concept of environmental human security is an essentially contested concept lacking empirical credibility of the ways in which specific environmental changes affect individuals or communities in particular times/ places and how this alters over a period of time. The lack of an agreed definition on what constitutes human security makes the possibility of developing a framework unlikely. Answer:\n3.

Traditional security studies regards the search for empirically testable 'truths' to be detrimental to the pursuit of a practical analytical framework with which to study security, largely due to a recognition in the field that security was not limited to a narrow or easily defined set of 'real' principles. OR 2. Knowledge was regarded as subjective and doubts were cast on whether any empirically testable 'truths' or realities could be defined for certain. OR 3. Traditional security studies adopt a positivist approach, based in scientific objectivism that pursues the definition of specific 'truths' that can be empirically tested and validated. OR 4.

Choices: 1. Human insecurity is an interchangeable concept with environmental insecurity; environmental change invariably undermines human security because its impact is always 'human' and acts as a constraining or facilitating factor that determines the extent of human development. Environmental change and conditions will therefore be the primary determinant of a person's or community's capacity to adapt to their surroundings. OR 2. The ways in which environmental change can threaten the welfare of the international system is dependent on the extensity of poverty as the key variable determining a population's reactive capability. Environmental change would have a negative impact if resources were available to adapt to environmental change to sustain their existing income levels. OR 3. In terms of the social determinants of insecurity, environmental change does not undermine human security in isolation; larger scale processes affect people's sensitivity to environmental changes and their capacity to adapt, whilst past processes shape present insecurities and ongoing processes shape future insecurities. OR 4. The concept of environmental human security is an essentially contested concept lacking empirical credibility of the ways in which specific environmental changes affect individuals or communities in particular times/ places and how this alters over a period of time. The lack of an agreed definition on what constitutes human security makes the possibility of developing a framework unlikely. Answer:\n3.

Choices: 1. Transnational crime is regarded as a threat to economic development. Organized crime is seen as a threat to development insofar as it undermines the rule of law and deters foreign investment by increasing the level of insecurity in the host communities. Additionally, criminals often reinvest their proceeds in the legal economy and have unfair advantage through access to cheap capital and their ability to intimidate commercial adversaries. In societies with high levels of TNC, legitimate investors are often reluctant to commit resources. OR 2. TNC undermines democratic stability. In many states, transnational criminal enterprises have taken advantage of the instability that has accompanied the democratic transitions to post communist societies, using their influence in the upper reaches of the state and thus shielding themselves from law enforcement. The corruption of public institutions and the perceived inefficacy of the rule of law in new democracies contribute to undermining public confidence in and loyalty to the new regime. OR 3. The ability of transnational crime to evade state border controls and provide new avenues for the illicit transportation of goods and persons challenges the state's ability to exercise its core functions as guarantor of national sovereignty, the monopolization over the control of force, and as the provider of the common good. TNC criminal activities corrupt and undermine numerous state agencies, providing mechanisms by which their activities can affect the very nature of government and state policy in the host countries.

It is often referred to as a thermo-nuclear or hydrogen device and has unlimited destructive potential. OR 2. A fusion reaction is created when the nuclei of two light elements are combined, the reaction resulting in heavier elements fragmenting into smaller parts. This fragmentation releases energy of limited destructive capacity, the extent of energy released dependent on the mass of material used. OR 3. A fusion device is a two-stage process where a gun-type device is used to trigger a series of fission reactions with the cumulative result being the production of a high energy flash explosion with unlimited thermal energy. OR 4. Fusion weapons have a highly specific destructive effect. The heavier element produced from a fissions reaction, and the difference in mass from the two lighter nuclei (which is translated into an energy explosion) can be precision calculated.

Although trends suggest that terrorism shows little sign of abating there is some positive indication that international cooperation between countries will play an increasingly important role in collaboration with indigenous intelligence agencies. A meaningful international definition of terrorism would provide a useful framework for responding to the spectre of terrorism. OR 2.

Are all groups the same? Choices: 1. Religious terrorism seems to be one of the hallmarks of the post-Cold War age. Religious terrorism is understood to denote the extremist activities of Islamic fundamentalism. Al-Qaeda is the most prominent example of religious terrorist groups and is described as globally operational, although religious terrorism is not limited to the al-Qaeda network. Christian beliefs were used to justify the ethnic cleansing in Bosnia, as well as anti-abortionist assassinations in the USA. OR 2. Terrorist groups have drawn their ideas from ideologies. There was a wave of terrorist violence in Europe in the 1970s and 1980s rooted in various leftist and Marxist ideologies but these began to wane by the late 1980s. Right-wing groups are also present, often with overtly xenophobic and racist views, targeting migrants and foreign workers. OR 3. Groups defined by their ethnic or linguistic identifications are a broad category for the organization of terrorist groups. In some countries a large number of anti-colonial groups were ethnically based and used terrorist tactics in the wars of liberation.

The Chemical Weapons Convention (CWC) prohibited the possession or deployment of chemical weapons; however it failed to implement stipulations that would require signatories to declare their existing stocks of chemical weapons, to identify facilities that were once involved in chemical production, or to announce when their existing stocks would be destroyed. OR 2. The CWC made some important developments regarding the use and possession of chemical weapons and the destruction of existing stockpiles. However, the treaty failed to establish an independent body empowered with the capacity to check treaty compliance. Lack of supra-state authority has undermined the ability to enforce those developments. Given the anarchical nature of international society it may be in the national security interest to retain stocks. OR 3. Chemical weapons continue to exert a determining influence on international society. As early as the 1970s military strategists were convinced of the deterrence effects chemical weapons could have, comparable to the second strike survival logic of nuclear deterrence. The preferences of strategists resulted in continued manufacture and stockpiling of weapons creating an international crisis of stability. OR 4. While the CWC has been ratified by the majority of international society, some nations with a large chemical capability at their disposal have yet to enter into the treaty. However, to some analysts the destructive military potential would be limited, having a moderate effect on a well-equipped army in conventional warfare. Chemical arsenal essentially falls under the category of the \"poor mans\" weaponry, being simplistic and inexpensive whilst having limited military utility. However, the concern remains of the prospective impact a terrorist chemical attack could have on civilian populations. Answer:\n4.

Choices: 1. A nuclear blast produces EMP, a thermal light pulse, blast, and fallout at the moment of detonation. The electro-magnetic pulse occurs when gamma radiation interacts with matter (the atmosphere), \"the Compton effect.\" EMP produces a high voltage charge, harmless to humans but destructive to electronic systems. EMP effects are maximized at high altitude. However thermal-light pulse can produce flash blindness, retinal burn, and fire whilst the airburst can cause severe skin burns. OR 2. A nuclear detonation produces a shockwave resulting from a rise in atmospheric pressure and dynamic overpressure sufficient to destroy concrete structures. Blast effects were generally used by military planners to calculate casualty rates in a nuclear attack: It was estimated that 50 percent living in a five mile radius of a one-mgt airburst would be killed or wounded by blast effects. OR 3. Nuclear reactions in the initial nuclear detonation or the fallout can cause radiation poisoning, as irradiated debris is picked up by the nuclear fireball and lofted into the atmosphere. A dirty bomb uses chemical high-explosive to disperse radioactive material, relying on radiation to produce a lethal effect.

Given the anarchical nature of international society it may be in the national security interest to retain stocks. OR 3. Chemical weapons continue to exert a determining influence on international society.

The most important characteristics of weak states are their frequent inability to establish and maintain a monopoly of control over the instruments of violence. Even within states with well developed coercive power they do not always retain absolute loyalty and are faced with a real possibility of military intervention. Whilst armed forces are ill-equipped, poorly managed and prone to factional divisions, social actors are powerful enough to resist governance. Therefore, monopoly over the instruments of violence is infrequent. OR 2. Weak states possess high levels of social-political cohesion which is correlated to the hegemonic enforcement idea of the regime, which in turn becomes accepted to the point of being legitimized as the social norm. OR 3. Weak states have a monopoly on the instruments of violence and have the coercive capability to force compliance even when social actors attempt to resist.

Choices: 1. Human insecurity is an interchangeable concept with environmental insecurity; environmental change invariably undermines human security because its impact is always 'human' and acts as a constraining or facilitating factor that determines the extent of human development. Environmental change and conditions will therefore be the primary determinant of a person's or community's capacity to adapt to their surroundings. OR 2. The ways in which environmental change can threaten the welfare of the international system is dependent on the extensity of poverty as the key variable determining a population's reactive capability. Environmental change would have a negative impact if resources were available to adapt to environmental change to sustain their existing income levels. OR 3. In terms of the social determinants of insecurity, environmental change does not undermine human security in isolation; larger scale processes affect people's sensitivity to environmental changes and their capacity to adapt, whilst past processes shape present insecurities and ongoing processes shape future insecurities. OR 4. The concept of environmental human security is an essentially contested concept lacking empirical credibility of the ways in which specific environmental changes affect individuals or communities in particular times/ places and how this alters over a period of time.

Responding to terrorism solely in its manifest form (the war on terror and crime approaches) holds little potential for eradicating terrorism in the long-term.

Countermeasures will prove fruitless (or a perpetual fight) unless nascent discontent is addressed before it is radicalized. OR 3. All of these options. OR 4. A concern with counter-terrorism efforts is the potential consequences on civil liberties. The greatest danger comes when governments regard the battle against terrorism as warfare because most democratic countries permit greater restrictions on the rights of individuals during wartime.

Choices: 1. The Chemical Weapons Convention (CWC) prohibited the possession or deployment of chemical weapons; however it failed to implement stipulations that would require signatories to declare their existing stocks of chemical weapons, to identify facilities that were once involved in chemical production, or to announce when their existing stocks would be destroyed. OR 2. The CWC made some important developments regarding the use and possession of chemical weapons and the destruction of existing stockpiles. However, the treaty failed to establish an independent body empowered with the capacity to check treaty compliance. Lack of supra-state authority has undermined the ability to enforce those developments. Given the anarchical nature of international society it may be in the national security interest to retain stocks. OR 3. Chemical weapons continue to exert a determining influence on international society. As early as the 1970s military strategists were convinced of the deterrence effects chemical weapons could have, comparable to the second strike survival logic of nuclear deterrence. The preferences of strategists resulted in continued manufacture and stockpiling of weapons creating an international crisis of stability. OR 4. While the CWC has been ratified by the majority of international society, some nations with a large chemical capability at their disposal have yet to enter into the treaty. However, to some analysts the destructive military potential would be limited, having a moderate effect on a well-equipped army in conventional warfare. Chemical arsenal essentially falls under the category of the \"poor mans\" weaponry, being simplistic and inexpensive whilst having limited military utility. However, the concern remains of the prospective impact a terrorist chemical attack could have on civilian populations. Answer:\n4.

Choices: 1. The Chemical Weapons Convention (CWC) prohibited the possession or deployment of chemical weapons; however it failed to implement stipulations that would require signatories to declare their existing stocks of chemical weapons, to identify facilities that were once involved in chemical production, or to announce when their existing stocks would be destroyed. OR 2. The CWC made some important developments regarding the use and possession of chemical weapons and the destruction of existing stockpiles. However, the treaty failed to establish an independent body empowered with the capacity to check treaty compliance. Lack of supra-state authority has undermined the ability to enforce those developments. Given the anarchical nature of international society it may be in the national security interest to retain stocks. OR 3. Chemical weapons continue to exert a determining influence on international society. As early as the 1970s military strategists were convinced of the deterrence effects chemical weapons could have, comparable to the second strike survival logic of nuclear deterrence. The preferences of strategists resulted in continued manufacture and stockpiling of weapons creating an international crisis of stability. OR 4. While the CWC has been ratified by the majority of international society, some nations with a large chemical capability at their disposal have yet to enter into the treaty. However, to some analysts the destructive military potential would be limited, having a moderate effect on a well-equipped army in conventional warfare. Chemical arsenal essentially falls under the category of the \"poor mans\" weaponry, being simplistic and inexpensive whilst having limited military utility.

Choices: 1. Human insecurity is an interchangeable concept with environmental insecurity; environmental change invariably undermines human security because its impact is always 'human' and acts as a constraining or facilitating factor that determines the extent of human development. Environmental change and conditions will therefore be the primary determinant of a person's or community's capacity to adapt to their surroundings. OR 2.

Environmental change would have a negative impact if resources were available to adapt to environmental change to sustain their existing income levels. OR 3. In terms of the social determinants of insecurity, environmental change does not undermine human security in isolation; larger scale processes affect people's sensitivity to environmental changes and their capacity to adapt, whilst past processes shape present insecurities and ongoing processes shape future insecurities.

Choices: 1. Although trends suggest that terrorism shows little sign of abating there is some positive indication that international cooperation between countries will play an increasingly important role in collaboration with indigenous intelligence agencies. A meaningful international definition of terrorism would provide a useful framework for responding to the spectre of terrorism. OR 2. Responding to terrorism solely in its manifest form (the war on terror and crime approaches) holds little potential for eradicating terrorism in the long-term. It is clear that terrorism will remain a security threat for years to come unless the root causes are addressed. Countermeasures will prove fruitless (or a perpetual fight) unless nascent discontent is addressed before it is radicalized. OR 3. All of these options. OR 4. A concern with counter-terrorism efforts is the potential consequences on civil liberties. The greatest danger comes when governments regard the battle against terrorism as warfare because most democratic countries permit greater restrictions on the rights of individuals during wartime. As a consequence, viewing the struggle as 'war' tends to have connotations with the idea that temporary personal curtailment may be a necessity for long-term victory. Answer:\n3.

Although trends suggest that terrorism shows little sign of abating there is some positive indication that international cooperation between countries will play an increasingly important role in collaboration with indigenous intelligence agencies. A meaningful international definition of terrorism would provide a useful framework for responding to the spectre of terrorism. OR 2. Responding to terrorism solely in its manifest form (the war on terror and crime approaches) holds little potential for eradicating terrorism in the long-term.

Choices: 1. Although trends suggest that terrorism shows little sign of abating there is some positive indication that international cooperation between countries will play an increasingly important role in collaboration with indigenous intelligence agencies. A meaningful international definition of terrorism would provide a useful framework for responding to the spectre of terrorism. OR 2. Responding to terrorism solely in its manifest form (the war on terror and crime approaches) holds little potential for eradicating terrorism in the long-term.

Human insecurity is an interchangeable concept with environmental insecurity; environmental change invariably undermines human security because its impact is always 'human' and acts as a constraining or facilitating factor that determines the extent of human development. Environmental change and conditions will therefore be the primary determinant of a person's or community's capacity to adapt to their surroundings. OR 2. The ways in which environmental change can threaten the welfare of the international system is dependent on the extensity of poverty as the key variable determining a population's reactive capability. Environmental change would have a negative impact if resources were available to adapt to environmental change to sustain their existing income levels. OR 3. In terms of the social determinants of insecurity, environmental change does not undermine human security in isolation; larger scale processes affect people's sensitivity to environmental changes and their capacity to adapt, whilst past processes shape present insecurities and ongoing processes shape future insecurities. OR 4. The concept of environmental human security is an essentially contested concept lacking empirical credibility of the ways in which specific environmental changes affect individuals or communities in particular times/ places and how this alters over a period of time.

A meaningful international definition of terrorism would provide a useful framework for responding to the spectre of terrorism. OR 2. Responding to terrorism solely in its manifest form (the war on terror and crime approaches) holds little potential for eradicating terrorism in the long-term.

If a positive policy outcome is achieved, then we can say that limited force has been employed. OR 4. The distinction between limited force and full-scale war is crucial because resort to brute force means that diplomacy has failed.

OR 2. The CWC made some important developments regarding the use and possession of chemical weapons and the destruction of existing stockpiles. However, the treaty failed to establish an independent body empowered with the capacity to check treaty compliance. Lack of supra-state authority has undermined the ability to enforce those developments. Given the anarchical nature of international society it may be in the national security interest to retain stocks. OR 3. Chemical weapons continue to exert a determining influence on international society. As early as the 1970s military strategists were convinced of the deterrence effects chemical weapons could have, comparable to the second strike survival logic of nuclear deterrence. The preferences of strategists resulted in continued manufacture and stockpiling of weapons creating an international crisis of stability. OR 4. While the CWC has been ratified by the majority of international society, some nations with a large chemical capability at their disposal have yet to enter into the treaty. However, to some analysts the destructive military potential would be limited, having a moderate effect on a well-equipped army in conventional warfare. Chemical arsenal essentially falls under the category of the \"poor mans\" weaponry, being simplistic and inexpensive whilst having limited military utility.

Choices: 1. Although trends suggest that terrorism shows little sign of abating there is some positive indication that international cooperation between countries will play an increasingly important role in collaboration with indigenous intelligence agencies. A meaningful international definition of terrorism would provide a useful framework for responding to the spectre of terrorism. OR 2. Responding to terrorism solely in its manifest form (the war on terror and crime approaches) holds little potential for eradicating terrorism in the long-term. It is clear that terrorism will remain a security threat for years to come unless the root causes are addressed. Countermeasures will prove fruitless (or a perpetual fight) unless nascent discontent is addressed before it is radicalized. OR 3. All of these options. OR 4. A concern with counter-terrorism efforts is the potential consequences on civil liberties. The greatest danger comes when governments regard the battle against terrorism as warfare because most democratic countries permit greater restrictions on the rights of individuals during wartime. As a consequence, viewing the struggle as 'war' tends to have connotations with the idea that temporary personal curtailment may be a necessity for long-term victory. Answer:\n3. All of these options.\n\nQuestion: [question] Choices: [choices] Answer: [answer]\nQuestion: From a critical perspective, how does postcolonialism relate to security studies? Choices: 1.

'Greedy' states are those that seek to advance their power through territorial expansion, even when they are already secure in the status quo. 'Security seeker' states are those that only want to be secure in the status quo, although they might get drawn into arms races and war because of structural pressures in the anarchic international system. OR 2. 'Greedy states' seek territorial expansion as a result of pressures created by the international system. The anarchic nature of the international system makes states insecure, and greedy states seek to rectify this by any means necessary.

What are the inherent difficulties? Choices: 1. Perpetual, psychological and emotional factors are precluded from the adversary's calculations. In no-win situations therefore the adversary might calculate that temporary compliance is the best strategic option to buy time. OR 2. Coercive diplomacy leaves too much room for compromise. Actors engaging in such behaviour are unlikely to perceive their vital interests as threatened and regard issues as zero-sum because they are aware that force will be used. As a consequence coercive diplomacy can lead to lengthy resolution discussions. OR 3. The success ultimately rests on perceptual, psychological and emotional factors, giving rise to the risk that misperception or miscalculation will defeat even a well-executed strategy that otherwise meets all the requirements for success. OR 4. The political scope for offering inducements can become unlimited. The problem becomes particularly underlined when the risk of terrorism, WMD or equal military capability comes into play.
