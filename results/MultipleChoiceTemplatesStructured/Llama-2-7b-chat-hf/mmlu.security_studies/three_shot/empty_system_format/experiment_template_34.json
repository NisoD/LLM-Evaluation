Choices: 1. The Chemical Weapons Convention (CWC) prohibited the possession or deployment of chemical weapons; however it failed to implement stipulations that would require signatories to declare their existing stocks of chemical weapons, to identify facilities that were once involved in chemical production, or to announce when their existing stocks would be destroyed.; 2. The CWC made some important developments regarding the use and possession of chemical weapons and the destruction of existing stockpiles. However, the treaty failed to establish an independent body empowered with the capacity to check treaty compliance. Lack of supra-state authority has undermined the ability to enforce those developments. Given the anarchical nature of international society it may be in the national security interest to retain stocks.; 3. Chemical weapons continue to exert a determining influence on international society. As early as the 1970s military strategists were convinced of the deterrence effects chemical weapons could have, comparable to the second strike survival logic of nuclear deterrence. The preferences of strategists resulted in continued manufacture and stockpiling of weapons creating an international crisis of stability.; 4. While the CWC has been ratified by the majority of international society, some nations with a large chemical capability at their disposal have yet to enter into the treaty. However, to some analysts the destructive military potential would be limited, having a moderate effect on a well-equipped army in conventional warfare. Chemical arsenal essentially falls under the category of the \"poor mans\" weaponry, being simplistic and inexpensive whilst having limited military utility. However, the concern remains of the prospective impact a terrorist chemical attack could have on civilian populations. Answer:\n4.

Choices: 1. The global economy is interconnected, ensuring that energy security for one is dependent upon energy security for all. Thus all core powers have the same interests in maintaining and extending the conditions under which this market operates. As long as this economic order exists, conflict between major powers over energy reserves is highly unlikely.; 2. Energy scarcity is likely to lead to future disruptions in the global system and the emergence of a 'new international energy order', characterized less by liberal free-market trading than by statism and neo-mercantilism.; 3. Oil remains the lifeblood of the current order - an order that is based upon an unequal (and deeply unjust) distribution of wealth and power in favour of capitalist economic elites. Those who benefit most from the prevailing order will ensure that the flow of energy under favourable conditions continues to underpin their position in the global system.; 4.

Choices: 1. State responses to transnational crime have evolved in correlation to the increased threat posed to the integrity of the state. Organized crime has been regarded primarily as a national security threat to be addressed domestically. The institutionalized international approaches for information sharing have been predominately bilateral to the extent of bringing to justice perpetrators of crime that are seeking to evade justice.; 2. With the expansion of TNC in the 1990s, states became increasingly willing to take measures to reduce the asymmetries between countries through harmonization of legislation and increasing police capacity and networking. The government response to transnational crime has focused on targeting the individuals and organizations perpetrating the crime, rather than the criminal markets themselves.; 3. The US war on drugs has heavily influenced the construction of the governmental response to the growing perception that the phenomenon of TNC represents a national security threat. The approach has an emphasis on bilateral and multilateral cooperation on law enforcement combined with sticks on a bi-lateral basis to induce states to increase regulation and enforcement against TNC.; 4. The emergence of norms governing the response to address the spectre of organized crime and to harmonize legislation occurred with the evolving Global War on Terror in which the terrorism-organized crime nexus resulted in the militarization of law enforcement: the use of military technology and intelligence as opposed to addressing the underlying conditions that facilitate illicit trade through an international institutionalist response.

Choices: 1. Although trends suggest that terrorism shows little sign of abating there is some positive indication that international cooperation between countries will play an increasingly important role in collaboration with indigenous intelligence agencies. A meaningful international definition of terrorism would provide a useful framework for responding to the spectre of terrorism.; 2. Responding to terrorism solely in its manifest form (the war on terror and crime approaches) holds little potential for eradicating terrorism in the long-term. It is clear that terrorism will remain a security threat for years to come unless the root causes are addressed. Countermeasures will prove fruitless (or a perpetual fight) unless nascent discontent is addressed before it is radicalized.; 3. All of these options.; 4. A concern with counter-terrorism efforts is the potential consequences on civil liberties. The greatest danger comes when governments regard the battle against terrorism as warfare because most democratic countries permit greater restrictions on the rights of individuals during wartime. As a consequence, viewing the struggle as 'war' tends to have connotations with the idea that temporary personal curtailment may be a necessity for long-term victory. Answer:\n3.

Bloody and violent conflict between social forces is not consistent with the presence of the centralizing force with the capacity to attain monopoly of control over violence.; 2. The utility of explaining weak state insecurity with a comparison to the historical conditions of state consolidation in Europe does not stand in the contemporary context of global society because of the pervasion of international norms to prevent violent conflict from manifesting in the consolidation process.; 3. The contemporary state-building condition is constrained by the shortened time-frame operating within the established guidelines of international norms, a particular problematic rule of which is sovereignty. Thus, unlike some European entities which could not complete the state-building process and were absorbed into more viable units, weak states will remain quasi entities.; 4. Weak state insecurity originated from the denial of sovereignty as the norm and the corresponding extension of the right to inviolability of statehood.

Statistics show that instances of domestic terrorism are decreasing. International occurrences can be ten times higher in the figures of injuries and deaths, which may be attributable to the larger scale of force employed in terrorist operations. Successive numbers of internationally directed incidents of terrorism in 2002, 2003, and 2004, were higher than those in 2001.; 3.

The Chemical Weapons Convention (CWC) prohibited the possession or deployment of chemical weapons; however it failed to implement stipulations that would require signatories to declare their existing stocks of chemical weapons, to identify facilities that were once involved in chemical production, or to announce when their existing stocks would be destroyed.; 2. The CWC made some important developments regarding the use and possession of chemical weapons and the destruction of existing stockpiles. However, the treaty failed to establish an independent body empowered with the capacity to check treaty compliance. Lack of supra-state authority has undermined the ability to enforce those developments. Given the anarchical nature of international society it may be in the national security interest to retain stocks.; 3. Chemical weapons continue to exert a determining influence on international society. As early as the 1970s military strategists were convinced of the deterrence effects chemical weapons could have, comparable to the second strike survival logic of nuclear deterrence. The preferences of strategists resulted in continued manufacture and stockpiling of weapons creating an international crisis of stability.; 4. While the CWC has been ratified by the majority of international society, some nations with a large chemical capability at their disposal have yet to enter into the treaty.

Choices: 1. The West, notably Canada, Britain, and the US, have conducted research into the weaponization of Anthrax, Tularemia, Q-fever, Venezuelan equine encephalitis, and anti-agricultural agents. However biological weapons were generally viewed in the West as lacking military utility. Instead strategists have concentrated on nuclear and conventional capabilities.; 2. The Soviet Union carried out the most extensive research program into genetic engineering to weaponize naturally occurring diseases. However, the Soviets most likely saw their biological weapons program as a counter to the global-strike complex that was emerging in NATO in the 1970s or as a way to inhibit recovery in a nuclear exchange. Biological weapons programs should therefore be regarded in a Cold War context.; 3.

Human insecurity is an interchangeable concept with environmental insecurity; environmental change invariably undermines human security because its impact is always 'human' and acts as a constraining or facilitating factor that determines the extent of human development. Environmental change and conditions will therefore be the primary determinant of a person's or community's capacity to adapt to their surroundings.; 2. The ways in which environmental change can threaten the welfare of the international system is dependent on the extensity of poverty as the key variable determining a population's reactive capability. Environmental change would have a negative impact if resources were available to adapt to environmental change to sustain their existing income levels.; 3. In terms of the social determinants of insecurity, environmental change does not undermine human security in isolation; larger scale processes affect people's sensitivity to environmental changes and their capacity to adapt, whilst past processes shape present insecurities and ongoing processes shape future insecurities.; 4. The concept of environmental human security is an essentially contested concept lacking empirical credibility of the ways in which specific environmental changes affect individuals or communities in particular times/ places and how this alters over a period of time.

Choices: 1. Although trends suggest that terrorism shows little sign of abating there is some positive indication that international cooperation between countries will play an increasingly important role in collaboration with indigenous intelligence agencies. A meaningful international definition of terrorism would provide a useful framework for responding to the spectre of terrorism.; 2. Responding to terrorism solely in its manifest form (the war on terror and crime approaches) holds little potential for eradicating terrorism in the long-term. It is clear that terrorism will remain a security threat for years to come unless the root causes are addressed. Countermeasures will prove fruitless (or a perpetual fight) unless nascent discontent is addressed before it is radicalized.; 3. All of these options.; 4. A concern with counter-terrorism efforts is the potential consequences on civil liberties. The greatest danger comes when governments regard the battle against terrorism as warfare because most democratic countries permit greater restrictions on the rights of individuals during wartime. As a consequence, viewing the struggle as 'war' tends to have connotations with the idea that temporary personal curtailment may be a necessity for long-term victory. Answer:\n3.
