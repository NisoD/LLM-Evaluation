Choices: 1. Humans and bats evolved by natural selection, and whales evolved by Lamarckian mechanisms. or 2. Forelimb evolution was adaptive in people and bats, but not in whales. or 3. Natural selection in an aquatic environment resulted in significant changes to whale forelimb anatomy. or 4. Genes mutate faster in whales than in humans or bats. Answer:\n3. Natural selection in an aquatic environment resulted in significant changes to whale forelimb anatomy.\n\nQuestion: [question] Choices: [choices] Answer: [answer]\nQuestion: A lizard lacking a chemical defense mechanism that is colored in the same way as a lizard that has a defense mechanism is displaying Choices: 1. aposometric coloration. or 2. cryptic coloration. or 3.
