Establishing the session included checking the server certificate and executing a DiffieHelmann exchange, but the client did not provide a client certificate. Further, assume that the client and server are honest, that the client and server don\u2019t leak their keys, and that the cryptography is good. Which of the following attacks does TLS protect against?\n1. An attacker stealing the server\u2019s private key and reading the plaintext of recorded past connections.\n2. An attacker breaking into a certificate authority and creating a fake certificate for the server. Choices: 1. True, True, 2. True, False, 3. False, True, 4. False, False Answer:\n2.
