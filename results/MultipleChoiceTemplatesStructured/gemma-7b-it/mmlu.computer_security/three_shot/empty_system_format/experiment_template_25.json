Then the resulting h(\\cdot,\\cdot)h(\u22c5,\u22c5) is not collision resistant: to build a collision (H,m)(H,m) and (H\u2019,m\u2019)(H\u2019,m\u2019) choose random (H,m,m\u2019)(H,m,m\u2019) and construct H\u2019H\u2019 as follows: Choices: a. H\u2019=D(m\u2019, E(m,H)) OR b. H\u2019=E(m\u2019,E(m,H)) OR c. H\u2019=E(m\u2019,D(m,H)) OR d. H\u2019=D(m\u2019,D(m,H)) Answer:\na. H\u2019=D(m\u2019, E(m,H))\n\nQuestion: [question] Choices: [choices] Answer: [answer]\nQuestion: Statement 1| U2F is a stronger second factor than sending an SMS code to a user\u2019s smartphone.
