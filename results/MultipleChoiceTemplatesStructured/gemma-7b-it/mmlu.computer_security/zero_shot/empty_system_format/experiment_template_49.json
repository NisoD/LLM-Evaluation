The user unlocks the phone and runs Innocent. Innocent exploits a bug in the iOS kernel which allows Innocent to redirect execution inside the kernel to code that Innocent controls. Now Innocent can execute any instructions it likes inside the iOS kernel. Innocent is not able to exploit any bugs in the phone\u2019s secure enclave. Can Innocent read the user\u2019s private information stored in the phone\u2019s flash (e.g. Contacts and messages), or will the security measures described in the paper keep the data private? If Innocent is only able to see encrypted data, then the phone has successfully kept the data private.
