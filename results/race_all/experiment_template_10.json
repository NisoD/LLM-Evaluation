Is there power in positive thinking?\nResearchers in Canada just published a study in the journal Psychological Science that says trying to get people to think more positively can actually have the opposite effect: it can simply highlight how unhappy they are.\nThe study's authors, Joanne Wood and John Lee of the University of Waterloo and Elaine Perunovic of the University of New Brunswick, begin by citing   older research showing that when people get feedback which they believe is overly positive, they actually feel worse, not better. If you tell your friend who is slow to learn that he has the potential of an Einstein, _ . In one 1990s experiment, a team including psychologist Joel Cooper of Princeton asked participants to write essays opposing funding for the disabled. When the essayists were later praised for their sympathy, they felt even worse about what they had written.\nIn this experiment, Wood, Lee and Perunovic measured 68 students' self-esteem. The participants were then asked to write down their thoughts and feelings for four minutes. Every 15 seconds, one group of students heard a bell. When it rang, they were supposed to tell themselves, \"I am lovable.\"\nThose with low self-esteem didn't feel better after the forced self-affirmation  . In fact, their moods turned significantly darker than those of members of the control group, who weren't urged to think positive thoughts.\nThe paper provides support for newer forms of psychotherapy   that urge people to accept their negative thoughts and feelings rather than fight them. In the fighting, we not only often fail but can make things worse. Meditation   techniques, in contrast, can teach people to put their shortcomings into a larger, more realistic viewpoint. Call it the power of negative thinking. Question: According to the study of the Canadian researchers,   _  .. Answers: a. positive thinking is not as powerful as negative thinking; b. encouraging positive thinking may actually discourage people; c. happy people can think positively while unhappy people can't; d. getting people to think positively can strengthen their confidence\n", "Result": "b\n\nContext:", "GroundTruth": "b"}, {"Index": 17, "Instance": "Context: Last week I talked with some of my students about what they wanted to do after they graduated, and what kind of job prospects  they thought they had.\nGiven that I teach students who are training to be doctors, I was surprised do find that most thought that they would not be able to get the jobs they wanted without \"outside help\". \"What kind of help is that?\" I asked, expecting them to tell me that they would need a   or family friend to help them out.\n\"Surgery ,\" one replied.\nI was pretty alarmed by that response. It seems that the graduates of today are increasingly willing to go under the knife to get ahead of others when it comes to getting a job .\nOne girl told me that she was considering surgery to increase her height. \"They break your legs, put in special extending screws, and slowly expand the gap between the two ends of the bone as it re-grows, you can get at least 5 cm taller!\"\nAt that point, I was shocked. I am short, I can't deny that, but I don't think I would put myself through months of agony just to be a few centimetres taller. I don't even bother to wear shoes with thick soles, as I'm not trying to hide the fact that I am just not tall!\nIt seems to me that there is a trend towards wanting \"perfection\" , and that is an ideal that just does not exist in reality.\nNo one is born perfect, yet magazines, TV shows and movies present images of thin, tall, beautiful people as being the norm. Advertisements for slimming aids, beauty treatments and cosmetic surgery clinics fill the pages of newspapers, further creating an idea that \"perfection\" is a requirement, and that it must be purchased, no matter what the cost. In my opinion, skills, rather than appearance, should determine how successful a person is in his/her chosen career. Question: According to the passage, the author believes that_.. Answers: a. everyone should purchase perfection, whatever the cost; b. it's right for graduates to ask for others to help them out in hunting for jobs; c. it is one's appearance instead of skills that really matters in one's career; d. media are to blame for misleading young people in their seeking for surgery\n d\n\nContext: She was 6 years old when I first met her on the beach near where I live.

I always had a strong desire to dress in a certain way and to stand out from the crowd.\nI made my own toys when I was a young child and sewed my first skirt at just 10 years old. A friend's mother took one look at my skirt and told me that I should be a patternmaker. In high school I started making my own clothes, mostly changing other things because I never liked anything how it was when I bought it. During the last two years of school, I worked part-time for a small business that made hand-painted silk clothing and bags. The owner became the teacher who got me into design in the first place. Another useful bit of work experience then came when I worked at a showroom during fashion week and found it very exciting. From there I worked at a top clothing store while I got my business started.\nFor my business I started out with the idea that everything I did would be hand-made and one-of-a-kind, specially made for one individual who hopefully had the same tastes as me. Every morning I jumped out of bed, went to my studio and worked on my projects. This just showed how enthusiastic I felt about my work. And at night I even dreamed of new designs!\nFashion design is _ art. What I mean is that it's something close to you and something you can touch and feel, and actually interact with. My advice to any young person who wants to be a fashion designer is to get the basic skills early on, such as sewing and pattern-making. Even if you end up specializing, it's really important to understand all aspects of design in order to make high-quality clothes.\nAlso, if you dream of having your own clothing line, the best thing to do is start wearing your clothes. You have to try and do this because that's the way you're going to develop something that's all yours and unlike anyone else's. I passionately believe that the right clothing can make people feel better and give them more confidence. Question: When the author was in high school, she   _  ..

In high school I started making my own clothes, mostly changing other things because I never liked anything how it was when I bought it. During the last two years of school, I worked part-time for a small business that made hand-painted silk clothing and bags. The owner became the teacher who got me into design in the first place. Another useful bit of work experience then came when I worked at a showroom during fashion week and found it very exciting.

Every morning I jumped out of bed, went to my studio and worked on my projects. This just showed how enthusiastic I felt about my work. And at night I even dreamed of new designs!\nFashion design is _ art. What I mean is that it's something close to you and something you can touch and feel, and actually interact with. My advice to any young person who wants to be a fashion designer is to get the basic skills early on, such as sewing and pattern-making. Even if you end up specializing, it's really important to understand all aspects of design in order to make high-quality clothes.\nAlso, if you dream of having your own clothing line, the best thing to do is start wearing your clothes.

You spend countless hours at work, and it impacts your life in so many ways; it makes sense that you should be fully informed before making such profound decisions.\nDo you know how many different career choices are available to you? Both The Dictionary of Occupational Titles (American) and The National Occupational Classification (Canadian) list well over 20,000 different job titles. So unless you've actively explored a variety of career options, there's a very good chance that there are great possibilities available to you, and you don't even realize they exist.\nMatch your understanding of yourself with your understanding of possible career options. Once you have developed a good understanding of yourself, you will be able to combine that self-knowledge with your career and labor market research to determine potential careers that are a great fit for you.\nWhen you've made a well informed decision, then you're ready to make it happen. Making use of good career guidance and resources will help you to acquire the education, skills, and experience needed to get the job and learn and implement   effective job search strategies.\nTime spent understanding your needs, researching your career options and developing outstanding job search skills, guided by great career resources, is a powerful investment in your future.

There are various possibilities available to you of making career decisions.\n b\n\nContext: Many scientists today are convinced that life exists elsewhere in the universe---life probably much like that on our own planet. They reason in the following way.\n  As far as astronomers can determine, the entire universe is built of the same matter. They have no reason to doubt that matter obeys the same laws in every part of the universe. Therefore, it is reasonable to guess that other stars, with their own planets, were born in the same way as our own solar system. What we know of life on earth suggests that life will arise wherever the proper conditions exist.\n  Life requires the right amount and kind of atmosphere. This eliminates  all those planets in the universe that are not about the same size and weight as the earth. A smaller planet would lose its atmosphere; a larger one would hold too much of it.\n  Life also requires a steady supply of heat and light. This eliminates double stars, or stars that flare up suddenly. Only single stars that are steady sources of heat and light like our sun would qualify.\n  Finally, life could evolve  only if the planet is just the right distance from its sun. With a weaker sun than our own, the planet would have to be closer to it. With a stronger sun, it would have to be farther away.\n  If we suppose that every star in the universe has a family of planets, then how many planets might support life? First, eliminate those stars that are not like our sun. Next eliminate most of their planets; they are either too far from or too close to their suns. Then eliminate all those planets which are not the same size and weight as the earth. Finally, remember that the proper conditions do not necessarily mean that life actually does exist on a planet. It may not have begun yet, or it may have already died out.\n  This process of elimination seems to leave very few planets on which earthlike life might be found. However, even if life could exist on only one planet in a million, there are so many billions of planets that this would still leave a vast number on which life could exist. Question: At the end of the passage the author suggests that   _  .. Answers: a. it is impossible for life to exist on planets.; b. earthlike life could only exist on a few planets.; c. life could exist on only one planet in a million.; d. life could exist on a great number of planets.\n", "Result": "b\n\nContext:", "GroundTruth": "d"}, {"Index": 48, "Instance": "Context: Understanding the process of making career choices and managing your career is a basic life skill that everyone should understand.\nYour career decisions have such a profound effect on all aspects of your life.

They describe chocolate as \"something to die for\" or say \"death by chocolate\". Now they should bite their tongues! Evidence is showing that some kinds of chocolate are actually good for you in the following ways:\nA happier heart\nScientists at Harvard University recently examined 136 studies on cocoa-- the main ingredient in chocolate-- and found that it does seem to strengthen the heart. Studies have shown heart benefits from increased blood flow. These benefits are the result of cocoa's chemicals, which seem to prevent both cell damage and inflammation . \nBetter blood pressure\nIf yours is high, chocolate may help. Jeffrey Blumberg from Tufts University recently found that people with high blood pressure who ate 3.5ounces of dark chocolate per day for two weeks saw their blood pressure drop quickly.\nMuscle magic\nChocolate milk may help you recover after a hard workout . _ \nBetter for your skin\nGerman researchers gave 24 women a half-cup of special cocoa every day. After three months, the women's skin was moister  and smoother. The research shows that chocolate helps protect and increase blood flow to the skin, improving its appearance.\nBrain gains.\nIt sounds almost too good to be true, but research suggests that chocolate may improve your memory, attention span, reaction time, and problem-solving skills by increasing blood flow to the brain.

I didn't find the chimps' tea parties funny, nor the bird shows entertaining. Feeding time for seals was less painful, but their performances still seemed like they belonged more in a circus.\nAnd I hated circuses, especially the animal acts -- men teasing lions, girls balancing on elephants and monkeys playing football. I knew that every trick a circus animal did was unnatural, achieved through strict training and quite possibly cruelty.\nHappily, during my lifetime public attitudes and the law have changed. Circuses using wild animals are now almost extinct, and zoos have definitely evolved.\nWhen my children were young, I occasionally took them to our local zoo. The elephants were in tiny cages and the gorillas looked bored as they sat peeling bananas and staring at teasing visitors. Each cage had a sign which listed the animal's name and where it came from. But, back then, there was little information included about the environmental challenges they faced.\nAs a result, environmentalists and animal lovers often oppose zoos. \"Animals belong in the wild,\" is a common -- and understandable -- complaint. But what do the animals themselves prefer?\nGenerally speaking, zoo animals have a longer life. But -- you may protest -- they are not free. What? Free to be hunted and killed, free to die of hunger or thirst? Maybe sitting in a cage eating bananas isn't so bad.\nNot that such conditions are acceptable in modern zoos, due to the work of BIAZA, the British and Irish Association of Zoos and Aquariums. These days every zoo requires BIAZA's approval to operate, and the association sets the standards, observes conditions in zoos and develops animal-research programmes, both in the UK and abroad. BIAZA also organises the animal exchanges between zoos all over the world.\nConsequently, today, most zoo animals are born and raised in zoos, live in large, comfortable enclosures and are cared for by well-trained, knowledgeable and caring zoo employees. Of course it's no substitute for living in the wild but unfortunately this isn't always possible. Meanwhile, why not visit your local zoo and decide for yourself? Question: The passage is mainly about   _  .. Answers: a. how zoos have improved; b. whether a zoo should be closed down; c. a new environmental organisation; d. the difference between zoos and circuses\n", "Result": "a\n\nContext:", "GroundTruth": "a"}]}}
