Young Graduates Face a Different Situation in Job-hunting\n B\n\nContext: The $11 billion self-help industry is built on the idea that you should turn negative thoughts like \"I never do anything right\" into positive ones like \"I can succeed.\" But was positive thinking advocate Norman Vincent Peale right? Is there power in positive thinking?\nResearchers in Canada just published a study in the journal Psychological Science that says trying to get people to think more positively can actually have the opposite effect: it can simply highlight how unhappy they are.\nThe study's authors, Joanne Wood and John Lee of the University of Waterloo and Elaine Perunovic of the University of New Brunswick, begin by citing   older research showing that when people get feedback which they believe is overly positive, they actually feel worse, not better. If you tell your friend who is slow to learn that he has the potential of an Einstein, _ . In one 1990s experiment, a team including psychologist Joel Cooper of Princeton asked participants to write essays opposing funding for the disabled. When the essayists were later praised for their sympathy, they felt even worse about what they had written.\nIn this experiment, Wood, Lee and Perunovic measured 68 students' self-esteem. The participants were then asked to write down their thoughts and feelings for four minutes. Every 15 seconds, one group of students heard a bell. When it rang, they were supposed to tell themselves, \"I am lovable.\"\nThose with low self-esteem didn't feel better after the forced self-affirmation  . In fact, their moods turned significantly darker than those of members of the control group, who weren't urged to think positive thoughts.\nThe paper provides support for newer forms of psychotherapy   that urge people to accept their negative thoughts and feelings rather than fight them. In the fighting, we not only often fail but can make things worse. Meditation   techniques, in contrast, can teach people to put their shortcomings into a larger, more realistic viewpoint. Call it the power of negative thinking. Question: According to the study of the Canadian researchers,   _  .. Answers: A. positive thinking is not as powerful as negative thinking B. encouraging positive thinking may actually discourage people C. happy people can think positively while unhappy people can't D. getting people to think positively can strengthen their confidence\n", "Result": "B", "GroundTruth": "B"}, {"Index": 17, "Instance": "Context: Last week I talked with some of my students about what they wanted to do after they graduated, and what kind of job prospects  they thought they had.\nGiven that I teach students who are training to be doctors, I was surprised do find that most thought that they would not be able to get the jobs they wanted without \"outside help\". \"What kind of help is that?\" I asked, expecting them to tell me that they would need a   or family friend to help them out.\n\"Surgery ,\" one replied.\nI was pretty alarmed by that response. It seems that the graduates of today are increasingly willing to go under the knife to get ahead of others when it comes to getting a job .\nOne girl told me that she was considering surgery to increase her height. \"They break your legs, put in special extending screws, and slowly expand the gap between the two ends of the bone as it re-grows, you can get at least 5 cm taller!\"\nAt that point, I was shocked. I am short, I can't deny that, but I don't think I would put myself through months of agony just to be a few centimetres taller. I don't even bother to wear shoes with thick soles, as I'm not trying to hide the fact that I am just not tall!\nIt seems to me that there is a trend towards wanting \"perfection\" , and that is an ideal that just does not exist in reality.\nNo one is born perfect, yet magazines, TV shows and movies present images of thin, tall, beautiful people as being the norm. Advertisements for slimming aids, beauty treatments and cosmetic surgery clinics fill the pages of newspapers, further creating an idea that \"perfection\" is a requirement, and that it must be purchased, no matter what the cost. In my opinion, skills, rather than appearance, should determine how successful a person is in his/her chosen career. Question: According to the passage, the author believes that_.. Answers: A. everyone should purchase perfection, whatever the cost B. it's right for graduates to ask for others to help them out in hunting for jobs C. it is one's appearance instead of skills that really matters in one's career D. media are to blame for misleading young people in their seeking for surgery\n D\n\nContext: She was 6 years old when I first met her on the beach near where I live.

I was depressed; my life seemed completely out of balance.\n\"What's your name?\" She wouldn't give up.\n\"Robert,\" I answered.\n\"Mine's Wendy... I'm 6. Why are you so quiet?\"\nI turned to her and shouted: \"Because my mother died!\"\n\"Oh,\" she said quietly, \"then this is a bad day.\"\n\"Yes,\" I said, \"and yesterday and the day before and - oh, go away!\"\n\"Did it hurt?\" she asked. \"Did what hurt?\" I was annoyed with her, with myself.\n\"When she died?\"\n\"Of course it hurt!\" I replied angrily, misunderstanding.\nA month after that, when I next went to the beach, she wasn't there. Feeling guilty, ashamed, I went up to the cottage and knocked at the door. A young woman answered.\n\"Hello,\" I said. \"I'm Robert Peterson. I missed your little girl today and wondered where she was.\"\n\"Wendy died last week, Mr. Peterson. She had leukemia . Maybe she didn't tell you.\"\nI had to catch my breath, saying nothing.\n\"She seemed so much better here and had a lot of what she called happy days.

But then we looked at the picture of the sandpiper and slowly both of us began to smile, remembering the lesson that Wendy had left us.\nEven when life seems sad, joy can be found in the smallest of things.
