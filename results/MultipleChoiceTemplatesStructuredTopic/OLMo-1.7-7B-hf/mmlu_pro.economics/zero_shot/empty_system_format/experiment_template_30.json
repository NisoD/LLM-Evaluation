Capital widening is the practice of reducing capital investment to focus on labor-intensive production, while capital deepening involves increasing automation and capital intensity.\n4. Capital widening is when more capital goods are provided to the same number of workers, while capital deepening is when the number of workers is increased without changing the amount of capital goods.\n5. Capital widening occurs when the same amount of capital is spread over a larger workforce, leading to a potential decrease in productivity, while capital deepening is when additional capital is used to upgrade existing workers' tools and machinery.\n6.
