Marx differentiates between skilled and unskilled labor by the duration of labor, not by the type or quality of the work.\nII. Marx computes the value of skilled labor from training costs and measures it in terms of units of unskilled labor. He averages differences in natural abilities into the term 'socially necessary labor'.\nIII. Marx equalizes the value of all commodities by the average amount of labor, without considering individual skill differences.\nIV. Marx ignores the varied skills and natural abilities of people.\nV. Marx believes that the value of a commodity is determined solely by the skill level of the labor.\nVI. Marx suggests that natural abilities are irrelevant, as all labor is inherently equal in the creation of value.\nVII. Marx treats the value of labor as a reflection of the social status of the laborer, rather than the labor itself.\nVIII. Marx uses only the most skilled labor as a benchmark for determining the value of a commodity.\nIX. Marx attributes a fixed value to each type of labor regardless of skill level or natural ability.\nX. Marx proposes that the market adjusts the value of commodities according to the rarity of the skills required to produce them.
