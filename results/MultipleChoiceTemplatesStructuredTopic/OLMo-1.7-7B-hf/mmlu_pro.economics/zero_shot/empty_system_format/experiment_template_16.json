If he tries to sell some, he finds he can get a price of $61.50 per share for all 1,000 shares. If he offers only 500 shares, he can get a price of $61,625 which is $0,125 more per share. That is, reducing his amount sold by a half, he can get a price that is higher by about 1/500. If he sought a price of $61.75, he would sell nothing. Mr. A considers this an insignificant rise in price as a result of withholding his supply. Is this an example of a price-takers' market?
