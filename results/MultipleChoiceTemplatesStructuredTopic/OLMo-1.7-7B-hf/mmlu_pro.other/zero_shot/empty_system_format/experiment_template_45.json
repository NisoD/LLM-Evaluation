Choices: I. The Westphalian model of sovereignty promotes the idea of shared responsibility, arguing that states have a duty to intervene in a humanitarian crisis, regardless of the sovereignty of the affected state.\nII. Westphalian sovereignty and humanitarian intervention are not related, as the former is a political concept and the latter is a social one.\nIII. Westphalian sovereignty supports the idea of humanitarian intervention only when it is requested by the state in question.\nIV. The Westphalian concept of sovereignty emphasizes the importance of international cooperation and hence supports the idea of humanitarian intervention under the supervision of international bodies.\nV. The international society is governed by norms of Westphalian sovereignty that advocate non-intervention and the respect of state sovereignty as a means of achieving security. These norms are enshrined in the Charter of the United Nations, which bans the use of force between states except in self-defence or when authorized by the UN.\nVI. Theories of Westphalian sovereignty decree that principles of non-intervention are paramount to achieving security; this has been extended into the contemporary global security environment in which international bodies such as the UN condemn humanitarian intervention, regarding it as detrimental to state-centric security.\nVII. In its advocacy of global political institutions, the Treaty of Westphalia defined state sovereignty as being subjective to the behaviour of the political or ruling elite in that state, prioritizing human welfare over arbitrary values of sovereignty and thus legitimising humanitarian intervention where necessary.\nVIII. State sovereignty and principles of non-interference that underpin the Westphalian approach can be disregarded, provided that there is a consensus amongst international actors that human life within the state is at risk, and where that risk is from the actions of the state itself.\nIX.

Choices: I. There is little evidence to substantiate the claim that there is a real and increasing threat posed by the scale and scope of transnational crime in the 1980s to 1990s beyond the consensus that concern over the levels of crime were generated by the military re-conceiving its role in light of the dissolution of the Cold War.\nII. TNC is a response by the dispossessed in response to the asymmetric economic development of nation states and the inequity of global market capitalism married with environmental constraints on development.\nIII.

The hierarchical analysts believe that generally there has been a tendency of officials to have over-inflated the estimation of the levels of violence and wealth generated by their activities. If the wealth is not as great as is widely believed, their threat to the licit economy is vastly reduced.\nII. Hierarchical forms of organization are highly adaptable and small fluid groups enable a pronounced degree of resilience (attributable to the logic of supply rising to meet demand) against law enforcement efforts confined to rigid ranking of cooperation.\nIII. Hierarchical groups pose a serious degree of harm by their profit-driven crimes under centralized leadership.

Choices: I. Common findings in research organizations investigating environmental violence have failed to find quantifiable relationships between environmental and social variables and the cause of war. Analysis of aggregated data failed to establish a common causal mechanism. The extensity of possible variables being simply too vast, mitigating any definitive relationship.\nII. Strong states do not face the risk of conflict due to environmental changes, as they have the ability to mitigate the effects of these changes.\nIII. There is a direct link between environmental degradation and violent conflict, but this is not a concern for strong states due to their ability to manage resources effectively.\nIV. The environmental security agenda for strong states is not concerned with conflict, as these states have sufficient resources to manage environmental changes.\nV. Conflict over environmental resources is primarily a concern for weak states, not strong ones.\nVI. Environmental degradation can create conflict within a state, but this is not a concern for strong states as they have the resources to manage these changes.\nVII. Population growth and its relationship to environmental degradation can lead to environmentally caused conflict. There is therefore a linear link between population growth and environmental change, and environmental change is the critical determinant in the production of violence.\nVIII. Analysis of environmental violence research shows that there is a tendency among 'strong states' to be less prone to internal violent conflicts whereas states undergoing significant economic and political transitions are more prone to violent conflict.

Security studies has always favoured a wide range of subjects when considering the field of security. Different types of security, most notably of human security and economic security, have enjoyed a great deal of attention in traditional security studies, alongside military security. After the Cold War this approach was broadened to include other types of security such as environmental and personal security.\nIII.

The focus on military security in security studies has been consistent, but the methods of achieving it have shifted from traditional warfare to cyber warfare.\nV. Military security has emerged since the Cold War as the dominant sector within security analysis; both scholars and practitioners recognise the paramount importance of pursuing military security, based on the idea that military capabilities pose the greatest threat to human and state survival.\nVI.

Are they a help or a hindrance? Choices: I. Countries often resist international measures out of concerns over sovereignty.

Intelligence agencies are highly centralized, organized structures that operate at a maximum functional level within their domestic context. There is no reason to presume that collaboration would enhance their ability to contribute to the prevention of terrorism. The multi-agency approach would also broaden the scope for potential errors, miscommunication, and intelligence failures.\nIII.

Choices: I. Biological agents comprise bacteria, viral, and toxin agents. However, not every disease provides the basis for an effective biological weapon. An agent's storage, delivery, mode of transmission and its very resilience can shape its effects on a target population.\nII. Construction of the means to transmit biological weapons in warfare has focused on the use of vectors, for example lice, fleas, or mosquitoes, as a mode of transmission as a military weapon. These are favoured because the target would find it difficult to contain the source of the outbreak, placing the infrastructure of the target country under strain.\nIII. Military professionals believe that the majority of biological agents can be sufficiently stable in their effects to be used as a weapon. Resource requirements would be minimal as fermenters used to make vaccines could be converted for military production and relatively small quantities of the agent are required to produce highly lethal effects, making them an efficient and effective weapon.\nIV.
