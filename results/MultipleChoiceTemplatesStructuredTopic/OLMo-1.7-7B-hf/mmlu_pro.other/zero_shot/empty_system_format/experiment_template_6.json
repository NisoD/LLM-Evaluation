This requires a special material called a semiconductor. Since 1964, the most commonly used semiconductor has been silicon. Solar cells are manufactured using large prototyping machines called solar cell factories. They are expensive to build, but once built they do not need to be touched for many years. A solar cell converts only a small amount of the solar energy that hits it into electricity. This number is only about 10%. There are several reasons for this low conversion rate. The cells are sensitive to the direction they face. They are also limited by the amount of rain and cloud cover. On bright, sunny days, if a solar cell is facing directly toward the sun, it will produce the most electricity. Solar cells are often installed in groups of cells called an array.
