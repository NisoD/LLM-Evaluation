But high levels of progesterone exerts a negative feedback action on LH secretion, with a consequent decrease in LH secretion and eventual atrophy of the corpus luteum.

The endometrium produces a hormone that supports the corpus luteum throughout pregnancy. OR B. The body naturally adjusts progesterone levels during pregnancy. OR C. The placenta secretes a hormone, chorionic gonadotrophin, which takes the place of LH in preserving the corpus luteum.
