But high levels of progesterone exerts a negative feedback action on LH secretion, with a consequent decrease in LH secretion and eventual atrophy of the corpus luteum. Atrophy of the corpus luteum cuts the progesterone supply resulting in menstruation. Clearly, these events cannot take place after conception, or the embryo would get sloughed off. When conception occurs, the corpus luteum is seen to last through most of pregnancy. How can this be explained? Choices: I. The placenta secretes a hormone, chorionic gonadotrophin, which takes the place of LH in preserving the corpus luteum. This allows the corpus luteum to secrete high levels of progesterone without being shut off.\nII. The corpus luteum is replaced by a secondary organ that secretes progesterone during pregnancy.\nIII.

Choices: I. conjugation is prevented by the environmental conditions in which the paramecia live\nII. repeated fission in paramecia results in sterile offspring that cannot conjugate\nIII. the group of paramecia lacks the cellular structures necessary for conjugation\nIV. all individuals are identical genetically, and conjugation could not occur\nV. conjugation can occur regardless of genetic similarities\nVI. conjugation is only possible in the presence of a specific chemical signal absent in this group\nVII. conjugation requires more than two organisms\nVIII. conjugation only occurs at a specific time of year which has not yet arrived\nIX. conjugation results in no genetic diversity\nX. paramecia descended from a single individual are incapable of conjugation due to a mutation Answer:\n", "Result": "[answer]\n[question] Which of the following is a reason why conjugation would not be expected among a group of par", "MaxTokenProbability": null, "Perplexity": null, "GroundTruth": "IV. all individuals are identical genetically, and conjugation could not occur", "Score": 0.0}, {"Index": 715, "Instance": "Topic: biology\nQuestion: [question] Choices: [choices] Answer: [answer]\nQuestion: Black-headed gulls remove broken eggshells from their nests immediately after the young have hatched. Explain the biological significance of this behavior. Choices: I. The gulls remove eggshells to keep their nests clean.\nII. The gulls remove eggshells to reduce the scent that may attract predators.\nIII. The eggshells are removed as a source of calcium for the gulls' diet.\nIV. Removing eggshells is a way for the gulls to prepare the nest for future clutches of eggs.\nV. Removing eggshells prevents the eggs from being eaten by predators.\nVI. The behavior is a social signal to other gulls that hatching has successfully occurred.\nVII. Removing eggshells helps regulate the temperature within the nest for the chicks' comfort.\nVIII. Removing eggshells is a way to create space for the hatched chicks.\nIX. Eggshell-removing behavior reduces the chances of a nest being robbed, thus enhancing the survival of offspring.
