But high levels of progesterone exerts a negative feedback action on LH secretion, with a consequent decrease in LH secretion and eventual atrophy of the corpus luteum. Atrophy of the corpus luteum cuts the progesterone supply resulting in menstruation. Clearly, these events cannot take place after conception, or the embryo would get sloughed off.

The endometrium produces a hormone that supports the corpus luteum throughout pregnancy. OR II. The body naturally adjusts progesterone levels during pregnancy. OR III. The placenta secretes a hormone, chorionic gonadotrophin, which takes the place of LH in preserving the corpus luteum.

The corpus luteum spontaneously increases in size during pregnancy, which maintains progesterone levels without hormonal regulation. OR V. The corpus luteum is replaced by a secondary organ that secretes progesterone during pregnancy. OR VI. The corpus luteum is not necessary during pregnancy. OR VII.

Cofactors are the protein constituent of some enzymes and cannot perform enzymatic functions without their respective apoenzymes, which are larger protein portions. OR X. Apoenzymes are involved in the digestion of cofactors, which are dietary minerals necessary for enzyme activity.

Choices: I. conjugation results in no genetic diversity OR II. conjugation requires more than two organisms OR III. all individuals are identical genetically, and conjugation could not occur OR IV. repeated fission in paramecia results in sterile offspring that cannot conjugate OR V. the group of paramecia lacks the cellular structures necessary for conjugation OR VI. conjugation is only possible in the presence of a specific chemical signal absent in this group OR VII. conjugation is prevented by the environmental conditions in which the paramecia live OR VIII. conjugation can occur regardless of genetic similarities OR IX. paramecia descended from a single individual are incapable of conjugation due to a mutation OR X. conjugation only occurs at a specific time of year which has not yet arrived Answer:\n", "Result": "[answer]\n\n[question] What is the name of the first book of the Old Testament?

Explain the biological significance of this behavior. Choices: I. Removing eggshells helps regulate the temperature within the nest for the chicks' comfort. OR II. The gulls remove eggshells to keep their nests clean. OR III. Eggshell-removing behavior reduces the chances of a nest being robbed, thus enhancing the survival of offspring. OR IV. Removing eggshells is a way to create space for the hatched chicks. OR V. The eggshells are removed as a source of calcium for the gulls' diet. OR VI. Removing eggshells prevents the eggs from being eaten by predators. OR VII. The behavior is a social signal to other gulls that hatching has successfully occurred. OR VIII. Removing eggshells is a way for the gulls to prepare the nest for future clutches of eggs. OR IX. The gulls remove eggshells to reduce the scent that may attract predators.
