The first cousin put up his interest in the joint tenancy as security for a $20,000 loan and signed a judgment note. It was later entered as a judgment against the first cousin's interest in the real estate. The first cousin died a year later. The second cousin decided to sell the property, but the mortgagee filed an action to prevent the sale and to enforce his interest in the property. The second cousin defended on the basis that any lien on the first cousin's interest in the property was extinguished on the first cousin's death. Will the court enforce the lien of the mortgagee against the sale of the property by the surviving second cousin? Choices: a. Yes, because the second cousin's assent to the judgment lien was presumed by law and that assent destroyed the joint tenancy. or b. Yes, because the mortgagee has the right to enforce his interest in the property to recover the loan. or c. No, because a joint tenant cannot legally file a judgment note on just that joint tenant's interest because it would be an unconstitutional interference with the other's property rights. or d. No, because when the first cousin died the second cousin became the sole owner due to the right of survivorship, as per the joint tenancy which was still fully intact. or e.

In 2009, the wife executed and delivered to a developer a fee simple conveyance of the tract, which the developer immediately recorded. The deed did not contain any reference to the restriction noted above. After the developer acquired title to the tract, he commenced construction of a hotel complex on a portion of the tract that bordered an apartment building. The applicable recording statute in effect in this jurisdiction provides, in part, \"No deed or other instrument in writing, not recorded in accordance with this statute, shall affect the title or rights to, in any real estate, or any devisee or purchaser in good faith, without knowledge of the existence of such unrecorded instruments. \"If one of the daughters brings suit to enjoin the developer from constructing the hotel, the plaintiff will most likely Choices: a. lose, because the developer was a bona fide purchaser for value without notice of the restriction. or b. win, because either daughter has the right of re-entry for condition broken. or c. win, because the restriction on commercial use was recorded and thus the developer should have been aware of it. or d. lose, because a common development scheme had been established for the entire tract. or e. win, because either daughter's right to the tract vested immediately upon the developer's construction of the hotel complex. or f. lose, because the restriction was not included in the deed from the wife to the developer. or g. lose, because the wife had the right to sell the property without any restrictions. or h. win, because the developer violated the deed's prohibition against commercial use. or i. win, because the daughters, as the conservationist's only heirs, received a valid possibility of reverter from their father. or j. lose, because the restriction on the use of the property is unenforceable.

The man stumbled and dropped the box that he was carrying. Instantly, the box made a loud screeching noise. The box contained powerful fireworks, and the impact of the box hitting the ground had caused a large rocket to ignite.

In year 16, the agency abandoned the intended education use and sold it at a properly advertised auction under state law.

In 1994, the farmer delivered to his son, for a sum of $1,000, a deed signed by the farmer, naming the son and his heirs as grantee, and appearing valid on its face. The son neglected to record the deed. In 1998, an investor, aware of the existence of the farmer-to-son deed, sought out the farmer and asked to buy for $10,000 a deed of the farm from the farmer to the investor and his heirs. The farmer executed such a deed, and the investor promptly recorded it. The investor's intent was to acquire color of title and obtain ownership of the farm by adverse possession. In 1998, the investor constructed a fence around the farm. In 1999, the son presented his deed of the farm to a rancher and, for $15,000, paid by the rancher, signed and delivered a deed of the farm in favor of the rancher and his heirs. After receiving the deed, the rancher made no effort to search the title, to examine the property, or to record the deed.

A wide variety of frogs, turtles, snakes, birds, and other animals inhabited the yard. The ground was usually covered by several inches of standing water. The environmentalist's neighbors were not pleased with the condition of the environmentalist's yard. They complained that it produced foul odors, and they claimed that the standing water was a breeding ground for mosquitoes and other insects. Several months after the environmentalist converted his yard into a marsh, a real estate investor purchased the house closest to the environmentalist's back yard swamp. The investor lived in a large city several hundred miles away, and he purchased the house next to the environmentalist's for investment purposes. The investor rented the house to a family under a long-term lease. The tenant family complained frequently to the investor about being annoyed by the environmentalist's yard. If the investor asserts a nuisance claim against the environmentalist, the environmentalist's best defense would be Choices: a. that the investor failed to conduct a proper inspection of the property and surrounding area before purchasing the house. or b. that the investor owns the property but has rented it out, so the investor does not have actual possession or the right to immediate possession of the land. or c. that the environmentalist's yard is actually beneficial to the community by providing a natural habitat for local wildlife. or d. that the environmentalist has a right to use his property as he sees fit, as long as it does not harm others. or e. that the investor has not shown that the marsh has negatively affected the value of his property. or f. that the swampy condition of his yard attracts a variety of wildlife, which increases biodiversity. or g. that when the investor purchased the house, he knew or should have known about the swampy condition of the environmentalist's property. or h. that he had sound environmental reasons for maintaining the swampy condition of his yard. or i. that the standing water in his yard is not the source of the mosquito problem. or j. that turning his yard into a swampy marsh did not violate any zoning ordinance.

In an appropriate federal court, the distributor brings a suit against the Secretary of State and the Treasury Department to set aside the order barring the foreign country's imports on the grounds that it is inconsistent with the principles of our constitutional form of government. Which of the following is the most proper disposition of the distributor's suit by the federal court? Choices: a. Suit dismissed, because it presents a nonjusticiable political question. or b. Suit dismissed, because it presents a moot issue. or c. Suit dismissed, because there is no adversity between the distributor and the defendants. or d. Suit upheld, because the act violates the distributor's First Amendment rights. or e. Suit dismissed, because the distributor has not been directly harmed by the act. or f. Suit dismissed, because the act is constitutional under the war powers of Congress. or g. Suit dismissed, because the distributor cannot challenge a foreign policy decision. or h. Suit upheld, because the act is an overreach of the Treasury Department's authority. or i. Suit upheld, because the act is not narrowly tailored to achieve its purpose. or j.

The nurse attempted to pull the wheelchair back through the doors. This action caused the doors to close more tightly on the patient's foot, injuring it further.

During night time hours, when there were no employees in the warehouse, the building and its contents burned to the ground by a raging fire. The fire department ruled that the fire had an incendiary origin. The fire report, however, did not identify a perpetrator. The insurer responded by rejecting coverage and accusing the business owner of starting the fire. The business owner sued the insurance company in federal court for the policy proceeds to cover its property damages claim. At the trial on the business owner's civil claim for insurance coverage, the owner attempted to put several persons on the stand to testify to the owner's good character, which was submitted as proof that the owner did not commit the arson. The trial court ruled that the character evidence would be excluded because it was inadmissible character testimony under Fed.R.Evid. 404(a).
