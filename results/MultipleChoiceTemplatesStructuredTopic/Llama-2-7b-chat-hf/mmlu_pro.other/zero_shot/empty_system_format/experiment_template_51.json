They do concede that there is the risk that terrorists acquiring the weapon could create an existential threat to the international system, although the threat is not yet a reality. Furthermore, the ability to retaliate can eliminate an opponent's potential gain. | II. Deterrence has proved to have been a source of stabilization during the Cold War but proliferation pessimists contend that new states' development programs do not provide sufficient guarantees that the state sponsors will act as good custodians. Weak state structures might result in sabotage, accidental use, or even theft. There is also the problem of states developing technology under the guise of deterrence whilst having ulterior motives. Domestic pressures may result in a regime gravitating towards nuclear war fighting strategies to win a rapid victory and strengthen status. | III. Despite the recognition that the ability to retaliate (the secure second-strike capability) produces a situation known as crisis stability, there is no consensus on the impact of nuclear capabilities, whether a source of stabilization or an existential threat. However there is agreement that the spread of WMD capacity to non-state actors would be fundamentally detrimental to international security based on the recognition that existing deterrence strategies and capabilities do not address the use of nuclear weapons. Indeed whilst the possibility exists, states will have to heighten security efforts. | IV. There is a developing scholarly trend toward proliferation pessimism, a pattern which has gained momentum rather than subsided with the end of the Cold War. There is concern that accidental war may occur, either through misperception, psychological or technical problems that can lead to spiralling tensions which result in a failure of deterrence policy. In addition, normal accidents resulting from the inability of a state to capably anticipate human-machine interactions in the complexities of the international (and anarchical) system may also occur.

Choices: I. A fusion device is a two-stage process where a gun-type device is used to trigger a series of fission reactions with the cumulative result being the production of a high energy flash explosion with unlimited thermal energy. | II. A fusion weapon is a four-stage-bomb that uses a gun-type device to create a fission reaction, which then triggers a fusion reaction. The weapon has a specific destructive effect. | III. Fusion devices are single-stage bombs that use a fission reaction to trigger a fusion reaction, leading to a high energy explosion with limited thermal energy. | IV. A fusion weapon is a three-stage-bomb that uses an implosion device to create a fission reaction, which then detonates a fusion reaction. It is often referred to as a thermo-nuclear or hydrogen device and has unlimited destructive potential. | V. A fusion reaction is created when the nuclei of two light elements are combined, the reaction resulting in heavier elements fragmenting into smaller parts. This fragmentation releases energy of limited destructive capacity, the extent of energy released dependent on the mass of material used. | VI. Fusion weapons have unlimited destructive capacity because they can be precision calculated, while fission weapons have limited destructive capacity because their energy output depends on the mass of the material used. | VII. Fusion weapons use both fission and fusion reactions in a three-stage process to produce a limited energy explosion with high thermal energy. | VIII. Fusion devices use the principle of splitting heavy elements to generate energy, while fission devices combine light elements to release energy. | IX. Fusion weapons have a highly specific destructive effect. The heavier element produced from a fissions reaction, and the difference in mass from the two lighter nuclei (which is translated into an energy explosion) can be precision calculated. Bombs even within the multi-megaton range have unlimited military utility, their destructive capability can be manufactured according to the target. | X.

Choices: I. The rise of non-state actors like transnational corporations and international non-governmental organizations has effectively made the concept of state security obsolete. | II. Weak states have embarked on a protracted and difficult process to attain effective status. Long term security strategies have resulted in the adoption of measures to counteract the worst of the effects including the establishment of multi parties, economic liberalization and membership of the international community. | III. The Global War on Terror has had a positive effect on the state-building project. The fight against terrorism has redirected international attention and resources towards eradicating insecurities as part of the recognition of the multilevel factors facilitating the emergence of terrorism. Specifically this involves the controlling of the proliferation of arms. | IV. The problems of weak state insecurity have taken a low priority on the international agenda and solutions have not moved beyond the context of liberal multi-party democracy and free market capitalism. The problem thus far is that no one case of enforced neo-liberalism, either through conditionalities, regime change, peace-building, has succeeded in transforming a weak state into a strong state. | V. The failure of liberal reform has highlighted the increasing viability of the option of alternative forms of political organization beyond the state. Sub-state organizations are a practical solution to dealing with regions with endemic problems of weapons and poverty, whilst regional organization is a sustainable structural form in Africa and Latin America. | VI. The security dilemma of weak states can be solved by pooling their resources and forming regional security alliances. | VII. The weak state security dilemma is a myth, propagated by strong states to maintain global hegemony. | VIII. Weak states can become strong by adopting autocratic forms of governance and suppressing internal dissent. | IX. Weak states are not inherently insecure; it's their handling and response to security threats that determine their stability. | X.

Choices: I. Weak states do not utilize coercive capabilities in normal policy. State institutions typically have a developed bureaucracy which legitimizes the regime's ability to rule. Paradoxically, however, the more a weak state exercises its coercive power the more it reinforces its infrastructural power but reduces its ability to rule. | II. Weak states have a monopoly over social actors and are able to maintain control through the use of force. They also have well-equipped and well-managed armed forces. | III. Weak states have strong military capabilities and maintain absolute loyalty from the armed forces. They frequently intervene in social matters to maintain control. | IV. Weak states possess high levels of social-political cohesion which is correlated to the hegemonic enforcement idea of the regime, which in turn becomes accepted to the point of being legitimized as the social norm. | V. Weak states are characterized by a high level of social-political cohesion and a strong monopoly over the instruments of violence. The regime is often legitimized through the use of force. | VI.

Choices: I. Peace studies emerged as a field of research in the post-Cold War era, largely driven by the need to understand and address the root causes of internal conflicts and civil wars. | II. Developed as a response to World War I, peace studies focuses on disparities in wealth and resource allocation that exist within the global system, with the aim of promoting peace through the equal distribution of these resources. | III. Developed during the era of decolonization, peace studies focuses on the legacy of colonialism and its impact on conflicts and tensions in the global South. | IV. Peace studies emerged in the aftermath of the Vietnam War, primarily focusing on the issues surrounding war atrocities and the impact of war on civilian populations. | V. Peace studies developed after the Second World War as a response to the failure of International Relations to prevent global conflict following World War I. Initially, the field was conditioned by the nuclear arms race and East-West divide that characterised the Cold War, but was quick to embrace environmental concerns and the issues surrounding the North-South wealth/poverty divide. | VI.

A number of deployed Soviet (Russian) and strategic warheads and US tactical nuclear weapons have been withdrawn from service thereby removing the threat of total war by massive nuclear exchange. | II. The International Non-proliferation Regime has been rendered effectively defunct in the post-Cold War climate. State actors seeking to develop their own weapons capabilities have de-stabilized norms governing the use and control of WMD.

Choices: I. Biological agents comprise bacteria, viral, and toxin agents. However, not every disease provides the basis for an effective biological weapon. An agent's storage, delivery, mode of transmission and its very resilience can shape its effects on a target population. | II. Construction of the means to transmit biological weapons in warfare has focused on the use of vectors, for example lice, fleas, or mosquitoes, as a mode of transmission as a military weapon. These are favoured because the target would find it difficult to contain the source of the outbreak, placing the infrastructure of the target country under strain. | III. Military professionals believe that the majority of biological agents can be sufficiently stable in their effects to be used as a weapon. Resource requirements would be minimal as fermenters used to make vaccines could be converted for military production and relatively small quantities of the agent are required to produce highly lethal effects, making them an efficient and effective weapon. | IV. Inoculation programs against naturally occurring disease have eradicated the potential for viral agents to cause a global pandemic.

Choices: I.

Gender is a social construct that refers to the roles, responsibilities, and expectations placed on individuals based on their sex, while gender security is about ensuring the equal rights and safety of all genders. | III.
