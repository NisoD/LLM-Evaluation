Choices: I. Proliferation optimists dispute the claim that nuclear technology leads to a propensity of the holding actor towards war. They do concede that there is the risk that terrorists acquiring the weapon could create an existential threat to the international system, although the threat is not yet a reality. Furthermore, the ability to retaliate can eliminate an opponent's potential gain. OR II. Deterrence has proved to have been a source of stabilization during the Cold War but proliferation pessimists contend that new states' development programs do not provide sufficient guarantees that the state sponsors will act as good custodians. Weak state structures might result in sabotage, accidental use, or even theft. There is also the problem of states developing technology under the guise of deterrence whilst having ulterior motives. Domestic pressures may result in a regime gravitating towards nuclear war fighting strategies to win a rapid victory and strengthen status. OR III. Despite the recognition that the ability to retaliate (the secure second-strike capability) produces a situation known as crisis stability, there is no consensus on the impact of nuclear capabilities, whether a source of stabilization or an existential threat. However there is agreement that the spread of WMD capacity to non-state actors would be fundamentally detrimental to international security based on the recognition that existing deterrence strategies and capabilities do not address the use of nuclear weapons. Indeed whilst the possibility exists, states will have to heighten security efforts. OR IV. There is a developing scholarly trend toward proliferation pessimism, a pattern which has gained momentum rather than subsided with the end of the Cold War. There is concern that accidental war may occur, either through misperception, psychological or technical problems that can lead to spiralling tensions which result in a failure of deterrence policy.

Choices: I. A fusion device is a two-stage process where a gun-type device is used to trigger a series of fission reactions with the cumulative result being the production of a high energy flash explosion with unlimited thermal energy. OR II. A fusion weapon is a four-stage-bomb that uses a gun-type device to create a fission reaction, which then triggers a fusion reaction. The weapon has a specific destructive effect. OR III. Fusion devices are single-stage bombs that use a fission reaction to trigger a fusion reaction, leading to a high energy explosion with limited thermal energy. OR IV. A fusion weapon is a three-stage-bomb that uses an implosion device to create a fission reaction, which then detonates a fusion reaction. It is often referred to as a thermo-nuclear or hydrogen device and has unlimited destructive potential. OR V. A fusion reaction is created when the nuclei of two light elements are combined, the reaction resulting in heavier elements fragmenting into smaller parts. This fragmentation releases energy of limited destructive capacity, the extent of energy released dependent on the mass of material used. OR VI. Fusion weapons have unlimited destructive capacity because they can be precision calculated, while fission weapons have limited destructive capacity because their energy output depends on the mass of the material used. OR VII. Fusion weapons use both fission and fusion reactions in a three-stage process to produce a limited energy explosion with high thermal energy. OR VIII. Fusion devices use the principle of splitting heavy elements to generate energy, while fission devices combine light elements to release energy. OR IX. Fusion weapons have a highly specific destructive effect.

Choices: I. Biological agents comprise bacteria, viral, and toxin agents. However, not every disease provides the basis for an effective biological weapon. An agent's storage, delivery, mode of transmission and its very resilience can shape its effects on a target population. OR II. Construction of the means to transmit biological weapons in warfare has focused on the use of vectors, for example lice, fleas, or mosquitoes, as a mode of transmission as a military weapon. These are favoured because the target would find it difficult to contain the source of the outbreak, placing the infrastructure of the target country under strain. OR III. Military professionals believe that the majority of biological agents can be sufficiently stable in their effects to be used as a weapon. Resource requirements would be minimal as fermenters used to make vaccines could be converted for military production and relatively small quantities of the agent are required to produce highly lethal effects, making them an efficient and effective weapon. OR IV. Inoculation programs against naturally occurring disease have eradicated the potential for viral agents to cause a global pandemic.

Weak state insecurity originated from the denial of sovereignty as the norm and the corresponding extension of the right to inviolability of statehood.

Choices: I.

Gender is a social construct that refers to the roles, responsibilities, and expectations placed on individuals based on their sex, while gender security is about ensuring the equal rights and safety of all genders.
