How does he reconcile thiswith the varied skills and natural abilities of people? Choices: 1. Marx attributes a fixed value to each type of labor regardless of skill level or natural ability.\n2. Marx differentiates between skilled and unskilled labor by the duration of labor, not by the type or quality of the work.\n3. Marx ignores the varied skills and natural abilities of people.\n4. Marx proposes that the market adjusts the value of commodities according to the rarity of the skills required to produce them.\n5. Marx treats the value of labor as a reflection of the social status of the laborer, rather than the labor itself.\n6. Marx suggests that natural abilities are irrelevant, as all labor is inherently equal in the creation of value.\n7. Marx uses only the most skilled labor as a benchmark for determining the value of a commodity.\n8. Marx computes the value of skilled labor from training costs and measures it in terms of units of unskilled labor.
