Researchers used a prospective study design with a large sample size. Blood levels of C-reactive protein (CRP) were measured at baseline and women were followed for an average of 8 years. The following table shows the relative risk estimates of cardiovascular event (heart attack or stroke) within 5 years by quintile of CRP level for the 30,000 women. The first quintile is used as the reference category.  1 0.49 mg/dL Relative Risk Number of women  1.0 6000  2 >0.49-1.08 mg/dL 1.8 6000  Quintile of CRP Level 3 >1.08-2.09 mg/dL 2.3 6000  4 >2.09-4.19 mg/dL 3.2 6000  5 >4.19 mg/dL 4.5 6000  Based on the relative risk data above, one can conclude: Choices: 1. Decreasing CRP level appears to increase the risk of heart attack/stroke. | 2. There appears to be no association between CRP levels and heart attack/stroke. | 3. There is no risk of heart attack/stroke for women with CRP levels in the first quintile. | 4. Increasing CRP level appears to increase the risk of heart attack/stroke.
