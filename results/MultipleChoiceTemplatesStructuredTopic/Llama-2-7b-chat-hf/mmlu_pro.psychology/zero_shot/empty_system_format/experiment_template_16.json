The mechanical stimulation from rubbing triggers a reflex that causes the pupils to dilate and create patterned visuals.\nd. Friction from rubbing generates heat, which causes the illusion of light patterns.\ne. It happens due to the production of a natural hallucinogen when pressure is applied\nf.

The pressure exerted on the eye stimulates the receptor nerve cells at the back of the retina, which normally respond to light, and their response to this pressure, when communicated to the visual area of the brain, produce the experience of light.\nh.
