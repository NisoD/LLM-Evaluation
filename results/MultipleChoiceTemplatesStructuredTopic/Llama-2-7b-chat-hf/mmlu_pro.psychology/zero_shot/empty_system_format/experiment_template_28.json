Assimilation is learning completely new responses to stimuli. Accommodation is ignoring new stimuli. 3. Schemes are innate reflexes that cannot be changed. Assimilation is adapting new stimuli to fit into existing schemes. Accommodation is the rejection of new stimuli that don't fit into existing schemes. 4.

Accommodation is the adjustment of existing schemes to incorporate new information. 5. Schemes are the only form of infant learning. Assimilation is the process of ignoring differences between stimuli. Accommodation is the process of retaining old behaviors in the face of new challenges. 6. Schemes are unconscious behaviors.

Over the year, she has become fluent in social English. After a few months in a monolingual English second grade, her teacher refers her for evaluation because she has great difficulty with the basal reader used in the class. Two English proficiency tests administered to the student show that she performs above the mean for monolingual English grade peers in speaking and listening but well below the mean in reading and writing.

Choices: 1.  The discrepancy between the student's native language reading skills and English reading skills is related to the greater complexity of English. 2. The discrepancy between the student's native language reading skills and English reading skills is due to the different teaching methodologies in her previous and current schools. 3. The student's high scores in reading in her native language are misleading her actual reading capacity in English. 4.
