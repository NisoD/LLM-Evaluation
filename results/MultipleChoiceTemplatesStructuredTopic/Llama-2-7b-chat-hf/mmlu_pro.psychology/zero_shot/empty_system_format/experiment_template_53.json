Longitudinal study - Tracking the same group of students over several years would allow Professor Ek to see patterns and changes in online bullying behavior over time. OR VI.

Over the year, she has become fluent in social English. After a few months in a monolingual English second grade, her teacher refers her for evaluation because she has great difficulty with the basal reader used in the class.

The student's reading skills are being hindered due to her proficiency in speaking and listening. OR II. The student's difficulty in reading is due to lack of exposure to English literature. OR III. The student's high scores in reading in her native language are misleading her actual reading capacity in English. OR IV.
