The basis of conservatism is a desire for less government interference or less centralized authority or more individual freedom and this is a pretty general description also of what libertarianism is. Now, I can't say that I will agree with all the things that the present group who call themselves Libertarians in the sense of a party say, because I think that like in any political movement there are shades, and there are libertarians who are almost over at the point of wanting no government at all or anarchy. I believe there are legitimate government functions. There is a legitimate need in an orderly society for some government to maintain freedom or we will have tyranny by individuals. The strongest man on the block will run the neighborhood. We have government to ensure that we don't each one of us have to carry a club to defend ourselves.

It was a collection of about eight hundred proverbial sayings drawn from the Latin authors of antiquity and elucidated for the use of those who aspired to write an elegant Latin style. In the dedication Erasmus pointed out the profit an author may derive, both in ornamenting his style and in strengthening his argumentation, from having at his disposal a good supply of sentences hallowed by their antiquity. He proposes to offer such a help to his readers. What he actually gave was much more. He familiarized a much wider circle than the earlier humanists had reached with the spirit of antiquity.\nUntil this time the humanists had, to some extent, monopolized the treasures of classic culture, in order to parade their knowledge of which the multitude remained destitute, and so to become strange prodigies of learning and elegance. With his irresistible need of teaching and his sincere love for humanity and its general culture, Erasmus introduced the classic spirit, in so far as it could be reflected in the soul of a sixteenth-century Christian, among the people. Not he alone; but none more extensively and more effectively. Not among all the people, it is true, for by writing in Latin he limited his direct influence to the educated classes, which in those days were the upper classes.\nErasmus made current the classic spirit. Humanism ceased to be the exclusive privilege of a few. According to Beatus Rhenanus he had been reproached by some humanists, when about to publish the Adagia, for divulging the mysteries of their craft. But he desired that the book of antiquity should be open to all.\"\nJohan Huizinga, twentieth-century Dutch philosopher, Erasmus and the Age of Reformation, 1924\nAccording to Huizinga, Erasmus's legacy was more significant than that of earlier humanists because Choices: A. he wrote in a language that was understandable to the masses, unlike his predecessors\nB. he was less interested in the pomp and circumstance of academia\nC. he valued educating the masses more than his predecessors had\nD. he was more critical of the Church than his predecessors were\nE. he wrote exclusively about religious matters\nF. he made the classic spirit more accessible by teaching it\nG. he had a wider variety of interests than his predecessors had\nH. he had more support from the Church\nI. he was the first to translate Latin proverbs into the vernacular\nJ. he wrote a greater number of books than his predecessors Answer:\n", "Result": "F. he made the classic spirit more accessible by teaching it.\nExplanation:\nAccording to Huizinga", "MaxTokenProbability": "F", "Perplexity": 13.06, "GroundTruth": "C. he valued educating the masses more than his predecessors had"}, {"Index": 23, "Instance": "Topic: history\nQuestion: [question] Choices: [choices] Answer: [answer]\nQuestion: This question refers to the following information.\nThe following quote is from Voltaire in response to the 1755 Lisbon earthquake.\nMy dear sir, nature is very cruel.
