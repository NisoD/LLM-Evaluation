Some horses can only exhibit a trotting gait, while others exhibit only a pacing gait. In an attempt to determine the pattern of inheritance displayed by this trait, a horse breeder crossed a stallion (\\male) that came from a long line of pacers to several mares (\\venus) that were trotters.

Using the letters T and t to represent the dominant and recessive genes, respectively, identify the genotypes of the stallion, the mares and the foals. Choices: 1.
