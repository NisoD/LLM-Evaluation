But high levels of progesterone exerts a negative feedback action on LH secretion, with a consequent decrease in LH secretion and eventual atrophy of the corpus luteum. Atrophy of the corpus luteum cuts the progesterone supply resulting in menstruation. Clearly, these events cannot take place after conception, or the embryo would get sloughed off.

The endometrium produces a hormone that supports the corpus luteum throughout pregnancy. or II. The body naturally adjusts progesterone levels during pregnancy. or III. The placenta secretes a hormone, chorionic gonadotrophin, which takes the place of LH in preserving the corpus luteum.

The corpus luteum spontaneously increases in size during pregnancy, which maintains progesterone levels without hormonal regulation. or V.

Explain how these are channeled into the proper tubes so that the food goes into the stomach and the air goes to the lungs. Choices: I. Air is directed into the lungs by the bronchial sphincter, while food is funneled into the esophagus by the esophageal sphincter or II. When we swallow, the larynx moves up so that the glottis is closed by the epiglottis and the food or liquid passes into the esophagus behind the trachea. Breathing ceases momentarily during swallowing. or III. A flap called the tracheal flap opens and closes to direct food and air into the correct tubes or IV. Food and air passages are controlled by a series of muscular valves that open and close in response to swallowing or V. The tongue pushes food into the esophagus, while a muscular reflex diverts air into the trachea or VI. The nasal passage contracts to prevent food from entering the lungs while swallowing or VII. The diaphragm adjusts its position to guide food and air into the esophagus or trachea, respectively or VIII. The larynx contracts to direct food and air into the appropriate tubes or IX.
