Choices: 1. The Theory of SignalDetectability(TSD) maintains that the classical view of the 'threshold' is an oversimplification. It argues that a subject's report of a signal presence tells two things: the ability to detect the stimulus and the motivation to detect it. The classical view only considers discrimination/detection/recognition ability.\n2. TSD suggests that detection is purely a matter of chance, whereas the classical view is based on probability theory.\n3. TSD and the classical psychophysical view are identical in their approach to detecting stimuli, with no significant differences.\n4. The classical view relies on signal intensity alone for detection, while TSD introduces the idea of decision criteria set by the observer.\n5.

Over the year, she has become fluent in social English. After a few months in a monolingual English second grade, her teacher refers her for evaluation because she has great difficulty with the basal reader used in the class.
