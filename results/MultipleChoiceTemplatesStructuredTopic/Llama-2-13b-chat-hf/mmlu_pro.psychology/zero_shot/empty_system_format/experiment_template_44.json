Emotional reactivity is often increased\n\nExplanation: Attempting to teach a new behavior through the use of aversive techniques, such as punishment or negative reinforcement, can be difficult because it can increase emotional reactivity. This can lead to increased anxiety, fear, and resistance to learning the new behavior. Instead of leading to a permanent change in behavior, aversive techniques can create a negative association with the behavior and lead to a decrease in motivation to learn.
