Helmholtz's rule relates illusions to the brain's inability to properly process conflicting information from different senses.\n\nExplanation: Helmholtz's rule states that our perception of an object is determined by the most likely cause of the sensory information we receive. When conflicting information is received from different senses, the brain may have difficulty processing this information and may result in an illusion. This rule can help explain why we sometimes perceive illusions, such as the Ponzo illusion, where parallel", "MaxTokenProbability": "I", "Perplexity": 6.68, "GroundTruth": "I.
