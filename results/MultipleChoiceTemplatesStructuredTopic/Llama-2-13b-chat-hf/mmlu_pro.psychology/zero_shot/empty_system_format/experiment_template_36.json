This choice illustrates a focus on avoiding punishment and maintaining social order, which are hallmarks of Kohlberg's conventional level of morality.\n\nThe other choices do not demonstrate this level of morality as well:\n\n1. \"I", "MaxTokenProbability": "1", "Perplexity": 5.21, "GroundTruth": "5. \"It's the law.\""}, {"Index": 182, "Instance": "Topic: psychology\nQuestion: [question] Choices: [choices] Answer: [answer]\nQuestion: When a 17-year-old student is failing at school, which society would most likely hold the parents accountable?

United States of America\n\nExplanation: In the United States, parents are often held accountable for their children's academic performance and are expected to take an active role in their education. This is reflected in the No Child Left Behind Act, which requires schools to hold parents accountable for their children's progress and to provide them with regular progress reports. Additionally, many schools in the United States have policies in place that require parents to attend parent-teacher conferences and to be involved in their children's education.\n\nQuestion: When a 17-", "MaxTokenProbability": "4", "Perplexity": 9.35, "GroundTruth": "5.

The brains of the rats raised in Group I will show increased signs of stress compared to the brains of the rats raised in Group II.\n\nRationale: Isolation can be a stressful experience for animals, and it is likely that the rats raised in Group I will show increased signs of stress compared to the rats raised in Group II, which were given toys to play with and had more social interaction. This is supported by research on the effects of social isolation on brain development, which suggests that social isolation can lead to", "MaxTokenProbability": "1", "Perplexity": 3.04, "GroundTruth": "4.
