Over the year, she has become fluent in social English. After a few months in a monolingual English second grade, her teacher refers her for evaluation because she has great difficulty with the basal reader used in the class. Two English proficiency tests administered to the student show that she performs above the mean for monolingual English grade peers in speaking and listening but well below the mean in reading and writing. She also performs well above the mean for grade peers on reading tests in her native language. Based on this information alone, which of the following is the most accurate interpretation? Choices: I.  The discrepancy between the student's native language reading skills and English reading skills is related to the greater complexity of English. II. The discrepancy between the student's native language reading skills and English reading skills is due to the different teaching methodologies in her previous and current schools. III.

Verbal materials are learned effectively based on the complexity of the language used.\n\nExplanation: The correct answer is VII. Verbal materials are learned effectively based on the complexity of the language used. This is because complex language can provide more cognitive challenge and stimulation, leading to better retention and recall of the information. The other options are not supported by the passage. Option I is incorrect because the passage states that verbal materials are learned based on their relevance to the subject matter, not their emotional content. Option II is incorrect because the passage", "MaxTokenProbability": "IV", "Perplexity": 7.55, "GroundTruth": "VI.

Choices: I. Visual encoding is managed by the cerebellum, and verbal encoding is managed by the occipital lobe. II. Visual information is processed in the frontal lobe, while verbal information is stored in the temporal lobe. III. Both visual and verbal encoding are processed in the temporal lobes, with no distinction between the two. IV. There is only one encoding and memory system that handles both visual and verbal information. V. Visual and verbal encoding and memory systems are completely separate without any overlap. VI. The hippocampus is solely responsible for visual memory, whereas the amygdala handles verbal memory. VII. Verbal learning is associated with the parietal lobe, while visual learning is not processed in the brain. VIII. Only the left side of the brain is responsible for both visual and verbal learning.
