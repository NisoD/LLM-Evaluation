Choices: 1. Incidental memory and subliminal perception both require the subject's awareness 2. Incidental memory refers to the recall of stimuli that never reached the subject's state of awareness. Subliminal perception, also called subception, is when a stimulus is presented just below the threshold at which it can be consciously perceived. 3. Subliminal perception is the ability to perceive and recall stimuli that are presented at high speeds, whereas incidental memory is a type of memory that is used for routine tasks. 4. Incidental memory and subliminal perception are both processes that involve a high level of conscious effort and attention in order to encode and retrieve stimuli. 5. Subliminal perception is consciously perceiving high intensity stimuli 6. Incidental memory is the intentional memorization of stimuli for later retrieval, while subliminal perception refers to stimuli that are too weak to be noticed but still influence behavior. 7. Incidental memory is the deliberate memorization of information using mnemonic devices, and subliminal perception is the conscious perception of low intensity stimuli. 8. Incidental memory is the conscious recall of stimuli 9. Incidental memory involves the unconscious retention of information from daily experiences, while subliminal perception is the perception of stimuli that are presented above the conscious threshold but not remembered. 10.

Focus group - Discussing online bullying in a group setting would provide a range of perspectives and insights into the problem. 2. Naturalistic observation-observing instances of online bullying by monitoring middle school students' social networking behavior would provide the most accurate data and not raise important privacy concerns, because social networks are considered \"public\" space. 3. Experiment-the most convenient and ethical way to study online bullying is to randomly assign half of the participants to a group who experiences the independent variable (online bullying). 4. Content analysis - Analyzing the content of online messages and posts could provide insights into the nature and extent of online bullying. 5. Longitudinal study - Tracking the same group of students over several years would allow Professor Ek to see patterns and changes in online bullying behavior over time. 6.

Over the year, she has become fluent in social English. After a few months in a monolingual English second grade, her teacher refers her for evaluation because she has great difficulty with the basal reader used in the class.

She also performs well above the mean for grade peers on reading tests in her native language. Based on this information alone, which of the following is the most accurate interpretation? Choices: 1. The student's reading skills are being hindered due to her proficiency in speaking and listening. 2. The student's difficulty in reading is due to lack of exposure to English literature. 3.
