Over the year, she has become fluent in social English. After a few months in a monolingual English second grade, her teacher refers her for evaluation because she has great difficulty with the basal reader used in the class. Two English proficiency tests administered to the student show that she performs above the mean for monolingual English grade peers in speaking and listening but well below the mean in reading and writing.

Answer:\n", "Result": "\nCorrect answer: III. Interference Theory is supported if both groups recall the same amount from learning task A.\n\nExplanation:\n\nThe Decay theory suggests that memories fade over time due to the deterioration of the neural pathways that store them. In contrast, the Interference theory proposes that memories are actively suppressed by new information, leading to forgetting.
