Answer:\n", "Result": "\nAnswer: 3. learned helplessness.\n\nExplanation: Coach Peterson's decision to sit Jake out for the first quarter of the next game is an example of learned helplessness. Learned helplessness occurs when an individual feels that their behavior has no effect on the outcome of a situation, leading to a decrease in motivation and effort. By sitting Jake out, Coach Peterson is creating a situation where Jake feels the consequence of being late, but also learns that his behavior (being on time) has no effect", "MaxTokenProbability": "1", "Perplexity": 12.0, "GroundTruth": "6. omission training."}, {"Index": 180, "Instance": "Topic: psychology\nQuestion: [question] Choices: [choices] Answer: [answer]\nQuestion: The staggering and slurred speech of a person who has consumed too much alcohol is most likely the result of altered functioning in the Choices: 1. parietal lobe OR 2. corpus callosum OR 3. prefrontal cortex OR 4. limbic system OR 5. hypothalamus OR 6. thalamus OR 7. cerebellum OR 8. sensorimotor cortex OR 9. hippocampus OR 10. amygdala Answer:\n", "Result": "\nCorrect answer: 4. limbic system\n\nExplanation: The limbic system is responsible for regulating emotions, motivation, and arousal, and it is also involved in the processing of sensory information.
