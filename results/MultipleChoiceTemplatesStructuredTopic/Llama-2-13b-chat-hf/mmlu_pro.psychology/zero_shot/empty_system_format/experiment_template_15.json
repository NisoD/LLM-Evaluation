Helmholtz's rule relates illusions to the brain's inability to properly process conflicting information from different senses. g. Helmholtz's rule explains illusions as optical errors h. Helmholtz's rule implies that illusions occur due to a temporary malfunction in the visual system. i. Helmholtz's rule interprets our feelings based on immediate causes j. Helmholtz's rule explains illusions as a disruption in the brain's pattern recognition processes. Answer:\n", "Result": "\nCorrect answer: c. Helmholtz's rule explains illusions as incorrectly applied constancies and helps interpret our feelings based on 'most likely' causes.\n\nExplanation: Helmholtz's rule, also known as the law of good continuity, states that our perception of the world is based on the assumption that the sensory information we receive is consistent with our past experiences and expectations. When this consistency is disrupted, we experience illusions. According to Helmholtz's rule, illusions are not the result", "MaxTokenProbability": "b", "Perplexity": 6.11, "GroundTruth": "c.
