Over the year, she has become fluent in social English. After a few months in a monolingual English second grade, her teacher refers her for evaluation because she has great difficulty with the basal reader used in the class. Two English proficiency tests administered to the student show that she performs above the mean for monolingual English grade peers in speaking and listening but well below the mean in reading and writing. She also performs well above the mean for grade peers on reading tests in her native language. Based on this information alone, which of the following is the most accurate interpretation? Choices: A. The student's reading skills are being hindered due to her proficiency in speaking and listening. OR B. The student's difficulty in reading is due to lack of exposure to English literature. OR C. The student's high scores in reading in her native language are misleading her actual reading capacity in English. OR D. The student's reading difficulty is an early indicator that she will have increased academic problems as her coursework requires more reading. OR E.
