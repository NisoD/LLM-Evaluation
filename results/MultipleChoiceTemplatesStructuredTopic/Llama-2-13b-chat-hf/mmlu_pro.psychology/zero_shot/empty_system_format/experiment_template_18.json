Critical period.\n\nExplanation: The critical period refers to the specific time frame during which a particular developmental change or event must occur in order to have a lasting impact. This concept is often used to describe the timing of physical changes in children belonging to different cohorts. The critical period is thought to be influenced by both genetic and environmental factors, and is characterized by a high degree of plasticity, meaning that the developmental outcome is sensitive to experiences and events that occur during this time.
