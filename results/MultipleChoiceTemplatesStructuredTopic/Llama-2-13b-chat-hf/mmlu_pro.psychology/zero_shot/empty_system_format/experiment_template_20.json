Pictures require more cognitive processing.\n\nExplanation:\n\nPictures require more cognitive processing than words because they contain more information and are more complex. Pictures can convey multiple meanings and emotions, and the brain must process this information to understand the meaning of the picture. Additionally, pictures can be ambiguous, leading to a delay in association. In contrast, words are processed sequentially and are more standardized, making them easier to process quickly.
