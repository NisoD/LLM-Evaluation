Words are processed sequentially while pictures are processed in parallel, requiring more time to integrate.\n\nExplanation:\n\nThe time required to produce associations to pictures is greater than the time required to produce associations to words because of the way our brains process visual and linguistic information. Words are processed sequentially, one at a time, while pictures are processed in parallel, with multiple elements being processed simultaneously. This means that the brain has to spend more time integrating the information from a picture than it does processing a word.
