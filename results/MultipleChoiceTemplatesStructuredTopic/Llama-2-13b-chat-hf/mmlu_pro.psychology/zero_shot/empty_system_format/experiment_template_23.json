These coping strategies rely on internal resources, as they are based on the individual's own thoughts, beliefs, and attitudes.

Over the year, she has become fluent in social English. After a few months in a monolingual English second grade, her teacher refers her for evaluation because she has great difficulty with the basal reader used in the class. Two English proficiency tests administered to the student show that she performs above the mean for monolingual English grade peers in speaking and listening but well below the mean in reading and writing.

The student's reading skills are being hindered due to her proficiency in speaking and listening. | b. The student's difficulty in reading is due to lack of exposure to English literature. | c.
