When a client connects to a server, the server compares the ticket\u2019s expiration time to the server\u2019s current clock, and refuses to authenticate the user if the ticket expiration time is in the past. or b. The Kerberos server (KDC) refuses to establish new connections between clients and servers for expired tickets. or c.
