This can lead to a decrease in the demand for the currency, causing its value to depreciate.

The productivity of labor in country Z is 25 percent higher than in country X.\n\nExplanation:\n\nTo find the productivity of labor in each country, we need to divide the output by the number of workers.\n\nFor country X:\nOutput = 30000 units\nWorkers = 3000 persons\nProductivity = output / workers = 30000 / 3000 = 10\n\nFor country Z:\nOutput = 40000 units\nWorkers = 8000 persons\n", "MaxTokenProbability": "I", "Perplexity": 3.84, "GroundTruth": "C.

Choices: A. a decrease in net exports; B. an increase in net exports; C. an increase in the nominal interest rate; D. an increase in the real interest rate Answer:\n", "Result": "B. an increase in net exports\n\nExplanation: Expansionary monetary policy, which involves lowering interest rates, can increase aggregate demand and boost economic growth. One way it can do this is by increasing net exports, as a weaker dollar makes exports cheaper and more attractive to foreign buyers. This can lead to an increase in net exports, which can contribute to overall economic growth.

Answer:\n", "Result": "\nAnswer: E. The equilibrium price will fall while the equilibrium quantity will rise.\n\nExplanation: When the demand for a product falls, the equilibrium price will fall, and the equilibrium quantity will rise. This is because a fall in demand means that consumers are willing to purchase fewer units of the product at each price level. As a result, the suppliers will have to lower their prices to encourage consumers to purchase more units. However, if the supply of the product simultaneously increases, the suppliers will have to lower their prices even further to clear the market. This will lead to a fall in the equilibrium price and a rise", "MaxTokenProbability": "B", "Perplexity": 3.95, "GroundTruth": "H.
