Answer:\n", "Result": "\nAnswer: 4. The firm cannot earn a positive economic profit in the short run.\n\nExplanation: In the short run, a perfectly competitive firm cannot earn a positive economic profit because it cannot adjust its output in response to changes in the market price.

A monopoly has no competition, therefore it is less efficient.\n\nExplanation: A monopoly is a market structure in which a single firm produces and sells a product with no close substitutes. Since there is no competition, the monopolist can set prices and output levels at will, without being constrained by the market forces of supply and demand. This lack of competition leads to inefficiencies, as the monopolist may not produce the optimal level of output or charge the optimal price.

The equilibrium price will rise while the equilibrium quantity is indeterminate.; 10. The equilibrium price is indeterminate while the equilibrium quantity will remain unchanged. Answer:\n", "Result": "\nAnswer: 3. The equilibrium price is indeterminate while the equilibrium quantity will rise.\n\nExplanation: When the demand for a product falls while the supply simultaneously increases, the equilibrium price and quantity will change. The equilibrium price is indeterminate, meaning it could go up or down, while the equilibrium quantity will rise. This is because the decrease in demand puts downward pressure on the price, while the increase in supply puts upward pressure on the price. As a result, the equilibrium price may rise or fall, but the equilibrium quantity will increase due to the increase in supply.", "MaxTokenProbability": "3", "Perplexity": 3.55, "GroundTruth": "8.
