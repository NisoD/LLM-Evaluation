The acceleration principle can exaggerate and intensify fluctuations in the economy.\n\nExplanation: The acceleration principle, which states that the rate of change of economic activity is proportional to the level of economic activity, can have a significant impact on the business cycle.

Choices: 1. Increasing costs have no effect on specialization 2. Increasing costs force companies to merge, reducing the need for specialization 3.

Increasing costs enhance the degree of specialization.\n\nExplanation: As costs increase (decreasing returns to scale), companies may choose to specialize even more in order to take advantage of their comparative advantage and reduce costs. This is because specialization allows companies to focus on a specific area and become more efficient in that area, which can help to offset the increasing costs. By specializing, companies can produce goods and services at a lower cost than their competitors, which can help them to remain competitive in the market.

Suppose, too, that no matter how our farmer decides to apportion his 2 acres be-tween wheat and corn , his total costs of production remain at $25. If the price of corn is $1 per bushel and that of wheat is $2 per bushel, what will the farmer do to maximize his profits? Choices: 1. Lease the land to another farmer 2.

Air is free because its marginal utility remains constant, regardless of consumption.\n\nExplanation:\n\nThe marginal utility approach suggests that the value of a good or service is determined by its marginal utility, or the additional satisfaction or benefit that consumers receive from consuming one more unit of the good or service. In the case of air, its marginal utility remains constant, regardless of consumption.
