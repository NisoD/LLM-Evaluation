An oligopoly is defined by having a single firm with significant market power, while the rest have very little influence.\n9.

An oligopoly exists when each firm in an industry must contemplate the possible reactions of its rivals in deciding its own behavior.\n\nExplanation: An oligopoly is a market structure in which a small number of firms compete with each other. The key characteristic of an oligopoly is that each firm must consider the possible reactions of its rivals when making decisions about its own behavior.

Choices: 1. The AFC slopes downward due to a decrease in demand for the product, while the AVC slopes upward from the start due to increasing variable costs.\n2.

The AFC slopes downward as quantity increases because of increased efficiency in production, while the AVC initially decreases due to underutilization of variable inputs and then increases because of market forces.\n6.

An increase in the marginal propensity to consume.\n\nExplanation: The tax multiplier is the change in real GDP resulting from a change in taxes. An increase in the marginal propensity to consume (MPC) will increase the size of the tax multiplier because a higher MPC means that consumers will spend a larger portion of their income on goods and services, which in turn will increase the demand for goods and services and lead to a larger change in real GDP.\n\nTopic: Macroeconomics\nQuestion: [question] Choices: [choices", "MaxTokenProbability": "6", "Perplexity": 5.6, "GroundTruth": "6.

Increase both labor and capital so that both the marginal product of capital and labor rises.\n\nExplanation: When the price of labor is $2 and the price of capital is $1, the marginal product of labor is 200, and the marginal product of capital is 50. This means that for every additional unit of labor or capital used, the firm will receive an additional $200 or $50 in revenue, respectively.
