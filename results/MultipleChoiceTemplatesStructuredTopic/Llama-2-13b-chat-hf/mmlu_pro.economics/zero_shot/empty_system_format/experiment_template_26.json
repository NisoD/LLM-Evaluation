High production cost\n\nExplanation: Industrial goods, such as capital goods and consumer durables, are typically hit hardest by a recession because they have high production costs and long production times. This means that companies must invest heavily in research and development, design, and manufacturing before they can bring their products to market. As a result, these companies are often the last to recover from a recession, as they must wait for demand to pick up before they can justify the high costs of production. Additionally, the long production times for these goods make it difficult for companies to quickly adjust their production levels in response to changes", "MaxTokenProbability": "b", "Perplexity": 21.83, "GroundTruth": "a.

Increasing costs enhance the degree of specialization.\n\nExplanation: When costs increase (decreasing returns to scale), companies may choose to specialize even more in order to take advantage of their comparative advantage and reduce costs. This is because specialization allows companies to focus on a specific area and become more efficient in that area, which can help to offset the increasing costs. By specializing, companies can produce goods and services at a lower cost than their competitors, which can help them to remain competitive in the market.

Real GDP will increase by $24 million.\n\nExplanation: When the government of country Z increases spending by $12 million and raises tax collections by the same amount, it is engaging in expansionary fiscal policy. This means that the government is injecting more money into the economy, which can lead to an increase in real GDP. The increase in tax collections can also lead to a decrease in the budget deficit, which can further support economic growth.

Pressure from shareholders to maximize dividends.\n\nExplanation: According to Marx, capitalists are forced to accumulate because they are under pressure from their shareholders to maximize dividends. This pressure arises from the fact that shareholders expect a certain rate of return on their investment, and capitalists must constantly expand their businesses to meet this expectation.
