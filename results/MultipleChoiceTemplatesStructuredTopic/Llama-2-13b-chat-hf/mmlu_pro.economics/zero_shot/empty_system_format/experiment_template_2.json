Higher interest rates resulting from reduced borrowing due to contractionary fiscal policy Answer:\n", "Result": "\nCorrect answer: C. Lower interest rates due to borrowing to conduct contractionary fiscal policy\n\nExplanation: The \"crowding-out\" effect refers to the phenomenon where government borrowing to finance fiscal policy reduces the amount of private borrowing in the economy, leading to lower interest rates. This occurs because government borrowing increases the demand for loans, driving up prices and reducing the yield (interest rate) that lenders require for taking on the risk of lending. As a result, private borrowers may find it more difficult to obtain loans, and the overall level of private investment", "MaxTokenProbability": "C", "Perplexity": 4.05, "GroundTruth": "F.
