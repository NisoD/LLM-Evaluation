The government increases spending with a corresponding increase in taxes.\n\nExplanation: When the government increases spending and also increases taxes, it can lead to a decrease in real GDP. This is because the increased government spending can lead to inflation, which can erode the purchasing power of consumers and businesses.

Economy Y is closed. Ceteris paribus expansionary monetary policy is Choices: A. less effective in X because the policy will decrease net exports. | B. more effective in X because the policy will decrease net exports. | C. more effective in X because the policy will increase net exports. | D. equally effective in X and Y. Answer:\n", "Result": "\nAnswer: C. more effective in X because the policy will increase net exports.\n\nExplanation: In an open economy with flexible exchange rates, expansionary monetary policy will increase net exports by depreciating the currency, making exports cheaper and more attractive to foreign buyers. This will lead to an increase in aggregate demand and output, making the policy more effective in an open economy like Economy X. In a closed economy like Economy Y, the policy will have no effect on net exports, as there are no foreign buyers to purchase the country's goods. Therefore, option C is the correct answer.", "MaxTokenProbability": "B", "Perplexity": 12.53, "GroundTruth": "A. less effective in X because the policy will decrease net exports.", "Score": 0.0}, {"Index": 838, "Instance": "Topic: economics\nQuestion: [question] Choices: [choices] Answer: [answer]\nQuestion: The \"crowding-out\" effect refers to which of the following?
