Explanation: Marx recognized that skilled labor requires more training and socialization, and therefore has a higher value than unskilled labor. However, he did not believe that this value was inherent to the labor itself, but rather was a reflection of the socially necessary labor time required to produce the commodity. To reconcile the varied skills and natural abilities of people, Marx proposed that the value of skilled labor be computed from training costs and measured in terms of units of unskilled labor.", "MaxTokenProbability": "b", "Perplexity": 7.84, "GroundTruth": "b.
