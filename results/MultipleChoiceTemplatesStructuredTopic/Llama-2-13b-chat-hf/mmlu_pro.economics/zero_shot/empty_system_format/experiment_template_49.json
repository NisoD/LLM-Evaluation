Choices: I. a decrease in net exports; II. an increase in net exports; III. an increase in the nominal interest rate; IV. an increase in the real interest rate Answer:\n", "Result": "\nAnswer: II. an increase in net exports\n\nExplanation: Expansionary monetary policy, which involves lowering interest rates, can increase net exports by making domestic goods and services more competitive in the global market. This is because a lower interest rate makes foreign investment more attractive, which can lead to an appreciation of the domestic currency and a decrease in the price of imports. Additionally, a lower interest rate can make domestic goods and services more competitive, leading to an increase in exports. Therefore, option II, an increase in net exports, is the correct answer.\n\nTopic: economics\nQuestion", "MaxTokenProbability": "I", "Perplexity": 11.87, "GroundTruth": "I. a decrease in net exports"}, {"Index": 843, "Instance": "Topic: economics\nQuestion: [question] Choices: [choices] Answer: [answer]\nQuestion: Suppose the demand for a particular product falls while the supply simultaneously increases.

Answer:\n", "Result": "\nAnswer: III. The equilibrium price is indeterminate while the equilibrium quantity will rise.\n\nExplanation: When the demand for a product falls while the supply simultaneously increases, the equilibrium price and quantity will change. The equilibrium price will be indeterminate, meaning it could go up or down, while the equilibrium quantity will rise. This is because the decrease in demand will put downward pressure on the price, while the increase in supply will put upward pressure on the price. As a result, the equilibrium price and quantity will shift to a new point where the quantity demanded equals the quantity supplied.", "MaxTokenProbability": "I", "Perplexity": 4.07, "GroundTruth": "VIII.
