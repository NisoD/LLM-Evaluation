This is because an increase in aggregate demand can lead to an increase in real GDP, but it can also lead to an increase in the price level without a corresponding increase in real GDP.

Higher interest rates resulting from reduced borrowing due to contractionary fiscal policy Answer:\n", "Result": "\nCorrect answer: c. Lower interest rates due to borrowing to conduct contractionary fiscal policy\n\nExplanation: The \"crowding-out\" effect refers to the phenomenon whereby government borrowing to finance expansionary fiscal policy reduces the amount of private borrowing and investment, leading to lower overall economic activity and a decrease in interest rates. This occurs because the government's increased borrowing drives up interest rates, making it more expensive for private firms and individuals to borrow money. As a result, private investment and consumption are reduced, leading to a decrease in overall economic activity.", "MaxTokenProbability": "b", "Perplexity": 4.05, "GroundTruth": "f.
