To prevent the depreciation of their capital.\n\nExplanation:\n\nAccording to Marx, capitalists are forced to accumulate because they must constantly reinvest their profits to maintain the value of their capital. This is necessary to prevent the depreciation of their capital, as the value of their investments will decrease over time due to wear and tear, obsolescence, and other factors.
