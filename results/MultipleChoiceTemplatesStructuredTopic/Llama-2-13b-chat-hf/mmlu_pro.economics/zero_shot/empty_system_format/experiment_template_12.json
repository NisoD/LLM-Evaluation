High production cost\n\nExplanation:\n\nIndustrial producers of capital goods and consumer durables are typically hit hardest by a recession because they have high production costs and long production times, which makes them more vulnerable to fluctuations in demand. During a recession, demand for these goods tends to decrease, leading to a decrease in production and employment. Additionally, these industries often have high fixed costs, such as the cost of machinery and equipment, which can make it difficult for them to adjust their production levels in response to changes in demand.\n\nTherefore, the correct", "MaxTokenProbability": "B", "Perplexity": 22.08, "GroundTruth": "A.

Division of labor increases efficiency by improving skills, saving time, promoting innovations and allowing use of machines.\n\nExplanation:\n\nThe division of labor is an effective ingredient of efficient production because it allows for specialization and the development of expertise in specific tasks. By dividing tasks into smaller, more manageable parts, workers can focus on a particular task and become more skilled and efficient at it. This leads to increased productivity and quality of output.

Automobiles depreciate faster.\n\nExplanation:\n\nThe reason why common stock or bonds are considered more liquid assets than an automobile is because of the faster depreciation rate of automobiles. Automobiles lose value quickly over time, whereas stocks and bonds tend to hold their value better. This means that it is easier to sell stocks and bonds quickly and at a relatively stable price, whereas it may be more difficult to sell an automobile quickly and at a fair price.\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is A.

Answer:\n", "Result": "\nAnswer: C. equally effective in X and Y.\n\nExplanation:\n\nIn an open economy with flexible exchange rates, expansionary monetary policy will increase the money supply and reduce interest rates, which will stimulate domestic demand and lead to higher imports. This will have a neutral effect on net exports, as the increase in imports will be offset by the increase in exports. Therefore, the effectiveness of expansionary monetary policy is not dependent on the openness of the economy or the exchange rate regime.\n\nIn a closed economy, on the other hand, expansionary monetary policy will have a positive effect", "MaxTokenProbability": "B", "Perplexity": 12.42, "GroundTruth": "D. less effective in X because the policy will decrease net exports.", "Score": 0.0}, {"Index": 838, "Instance": "Topic: economics\nQuestion: [question] Choices: [choices] Answer: [answer]\nQuestion: The \"crowding-out\" effect refers to which of the following?
