The tax is regressive because higher incomes are taxed at a higher rate.\n\nExplanation: The federal payroll tax that supports the Social Security program is regressive because it taxes higher incomes at a higher rate. This means that individuals with higher incomes will pay a higher percentage of their income in taxes than those with lower incomes.
