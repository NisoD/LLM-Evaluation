Higher interest rates resulting from reduced borrowing due to contractionary fiscal policy Answer:\n", "Result": "\nBrief Explanation: The \"crowding-out\" effect refers to the phenomenon whereby government borrowing to finance expansionary fiscal policy causes interest rates to rise, thereby reducing the private sector's ability to borrow and invest. This occurs when the government borrows money to finance its spending, which increases demand for loans and drives up interest rates. As a result, private businesses and consumers may find it more difficult to obtain credit, which can limit their ability to invest and consume, and potentially slow down economic growth.\n\nCorrect Answer: III.

The federal government spends less money.\n\nExplanation: When the federal government spends less money, it reduces the amount of money that is being injected into the economy. This can lead to a decrease in the money supply, as there is less money available for people and businesses to spend. The other options do not lead to a decrease in the money supply.
