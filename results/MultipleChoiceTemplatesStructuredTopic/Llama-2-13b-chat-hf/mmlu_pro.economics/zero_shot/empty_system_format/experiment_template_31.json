A significant degree of resource misallocation Answer:\n", "Result": "\nCorrect answer: 10. A significant degree of resource misallocation\n\nExplanation: The farm problem can be seen as a problem of resource misallocation because resources such as land, labor, and capital are not being used efficiently in agriculture. This can be due to various factors such as lack of access to technology, inadequate infrastructure, and inefficient farming methods. As a result, farmers may not be able to produce goods and services at the lowest possible cost, leading to wastage and inefficiency in the agricultural sector.\n\nNote: This question is based on the", "MaxTokenProbability": "4", "Perplexity": 8.39, "GroundTruth": "10.

Use a logarithmic functional form instead of a linear one\n\nExplanation: Residual non-normality can be a problem for linear regression models, as many standard diagnostic tests and inference methods assume normality of the residuals. One possible response to a finding of residual non-normality is to use a logarithmic functional form instead of a linear one. This can help to transform the data into a more normal distribution, which can improve the accuracy of the regression model and make it easier to interpret the results.\n\nTopic: statistics\nQuestion: [question] Choices: [", "MaxTokenProbability": "2", "Perplexity": 15.26, "GroundTruth": "3.

The government increases spending with a corresponding increase in taxes.\n\nExplanation: When the government increases spending, it can lead to an increase in aggregate demand, which can boost real GDP. However, if the government does not increase taxes to pay for the increased spending, it can lead to inflation.
