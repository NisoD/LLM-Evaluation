Postponability and monopoly power Explanation: Industrial producers of capital goods and consumer durables are typically hit hardest by a recession because their products are often postponable, meaning that consumers and businesses can delay purchases of these goods until the economy improves. Additionally, these producers may have monopoly power, which means that they have limited competition and are less able to adjust their prices or production levels in response to changing market conditions. As a result, they may be more vulnerable to economic downturns.\n\nTopic: economics\nQuestion: [question] Cho", "MaxTokenProbability": "d", "Perplexity": 21.04, "GroundTruth": "d.

Higher interest rates resulting from reduced borrowing due to contractionary fiscal policy Answer:\n", "Result": "\nCorrect answer: a. Lower interest rates that result from borrowing to conduct expansionary monetary policy\n\nExplanation: The \"crowding-out\" effect refers to the phenomenon whereby an increase in government borrowing to finance expansionary fiscal policy leads to higher interest rates, as the increased demand for borrowed funds drives up their price. This, in turn, can negate some of the positive effects of the fiscal policy on the economy, as higher interest rates can reduce consumption and investment.

Answer:\n", "Result": "b.
