Postponability and monopoly power Explanation: Industrial producers of capital goods and consumer durables are typically hit hardest by a recession because their products are often postponable, meaning that consumers and businesses can delay purchases of these goods until the economy improves. Additionally, these producers may have monopoly power, which means that they have limited competition and can therefore raise prices and reduce production during a recession. This can lead to a decline in demand for their products and a decrease in production and employment.\n\nTopic: economics\nQuestion: [question] Cho", "MaxTokenProbability": "D", "Perplexity": 20.57, "GroundTruth": "D.

This concept is often used in the context of taxation, where a government may impose a tax that is passed on to consumers in the form of higher prices (forward shifting) or to workers in the form of lower wages (backward shifting).

Answer:\n", "Result": "\nAnswer: C. Marshall synthesized the views of earlier writers into a new theory of price.\n\nExplanation: Alfred Marshall's contribution to the debate on price determination was to synthesize the views of earlier writers into a new theory of price. He incorporated elements from both the classical economists, who emphasized cost of production, and the marginalists, who emphasized demand. Marshall's theory of price took into account both the cost of production and the demand for goods and services, and he argued that price is determined by the intersection of the supply and demand curves.
