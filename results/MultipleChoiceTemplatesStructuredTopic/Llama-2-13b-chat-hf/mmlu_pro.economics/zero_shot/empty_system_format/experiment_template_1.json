Choices: A. Lack of skilled labor B. High production cost C. Inadequate infrastructure D. Postponability and monopoly power Answer:\n", "Result": "D.

This can lead to a decline in demand for their products and a decrease in production and employment.\n\nTopic: economics\nQuestion: [question] Cho", "MaxTokenProbability": "D", "Perplexity": 20.57, "GroundTruth": "D.
