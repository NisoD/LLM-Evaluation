Choices: A. a decrease in net exports, B. an increase in net exports, C. an increase in the nominal interest rate, D. an increase in the real interest rate Answer:\n", "Result": "B. an increase in net exports\n\nExplanation: Expansionary monetary policy, which includes lowering interest rates and increasing the money supply, can increase aggregate demand and boost economic growth. One of the channels through which this policy can operate is by depreciating the exchange rate and making exports cheaper and more competitive in foreign markets. This can lead to an increase in net exports, as more goods and services are sold abroad. Therefore, option B is the correct answer.\n\nNote: The other options are incorrect because:\n\nA.

Answer:\n", "Result": "\nAnswer: E. The equilibrium price will fall while the equilibrium quantity will rise.\n\nExplanation: When the demand for a product falls, the equilibrium price will fall, and the equilibrium quantity will rise. This is because a fall in demand means that consumers are willing to purchase fewer units of the product at each price level. As a result, the suppliers will have to lower their prices to encourage consumers to purchase more units. This will lead to a decrease in the equilibrium price and an increase in the equilibrium quantity.\n\nOn the other hand, if the supply of the product increases, the equilibrium price will fall, but", "MaxTokenProbability": "E", "Perplexity": 3.55, "GroundTruth": "H.
