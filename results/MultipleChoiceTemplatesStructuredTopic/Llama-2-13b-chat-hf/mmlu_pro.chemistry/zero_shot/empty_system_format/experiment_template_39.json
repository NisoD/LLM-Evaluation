To do this, a piece of dry limestone was weighed. Then carbon dioxide was collected until the limestone disappeared. The atmospheric pressure was measured at 0.965 atm. The temperature was 295 K. The volume of CO2 was measured to the nearest mL and corrected for the vapor pressure of water. The student continuously got low results from what was expected. Can you suggest why? Choices: 1. The measurement of atmospheric pressure was incorrect. OR 2. Carbon dioxide is rather soluble in water. OR 3. Limestone is Ca(HCO3)2. OR 4. The volume of CO2 was not measured correctly. OR 5. Limestone is never pure CaCO3. OR 6. Perhaps there was too much acid, which interfered with the results. OR 7. The vapor pressure of water was not correctly accounted for. OR 8.
