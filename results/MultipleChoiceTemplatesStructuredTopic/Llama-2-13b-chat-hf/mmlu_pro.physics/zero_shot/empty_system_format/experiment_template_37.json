As a pilot's body undergoes centripetal acceleration, with the head toward the center of curvature, the blood pressure in the brain decreases, leading to loss of brain function.\nThere are several warning signs. When the centripetal acceleration is $2 g$ or $3 g$, the pilot feels heavy. At about $4 g$, the pilot's vision switches to black and white and narrows to \"tunnel vision.\" If that acceleration is sustained or increased, vision ceases and, soon after, the pilot is unconscious - a condition known as $g$-LOC for \" $g$-induced loss of consciousness.\"\n\nWhat is the magnitude of the acceleration, in $g$ units, of a pilot whose aircraft enters a horizontal circular turn with a velocity of $\\vec{v}_i=(400 \\hat{\\mathrm{i}}+500 \\hat{\\mathrm{j}}) \\mathrm{m} / \\mathrm{s}$ and $24.0 \\mathrm{~s}$ later leaves the turn with a velocity of $\\vec{v}_f=(-400 \\hat{\\mathrm{i}}-500 \\hat{\\mathrm{j}}) \\mathrm{m} / \\mathrm{s}$ ?
