This is because gene flow can lead to the creation of new genetic combinations that are not present in either of the parent populations, which can result in the formation of new species.\n\nNote: The other options are incorrect because:\n\na", "MaxTokenProbability": "b", "Perplexity": 5.23, "GroundTruth": "g. an increase in genetic homogeneity in the metapopulation", "Score": 0.0}, {"Index": 315, "Instance": "Topic: biology\nQuestion: [question] Choices: [choices] Answer: [answer]\nQuestion: Describe locomotion in the amoeba.

Amoebas use jet propulsion by expelling water from their bodies to move. OR d. The amoeba secretes a slime trail and glides forward with rhythmic muscle contractions. OR e. The amoeba propels itself forward using tiny hair-like structures called cilia. OR f. The amoeba uses flagella for locomotion. OR g. The locomotion of amoeba involves the projection of a pseudopodium, into which the inner endoplasm flows, causing the organism to advance.
