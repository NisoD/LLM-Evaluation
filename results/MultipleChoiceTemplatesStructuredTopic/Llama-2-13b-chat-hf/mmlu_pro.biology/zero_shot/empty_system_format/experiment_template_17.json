How does the additional 70% become filled? Describe the process of the cardiac cycle in general. Choices: a. 70% of the ventricular filling occurs during diastole due to passive flow as the atrial pressure is greater than the ventricular pressure.\nb. The remaining 70% of ventricular filling is due to contraction of the atria.\nc. Ventricular filling is completed by muscular constriction of the ventricles.\nd. The remaining ventricular space is filled by pulmonary backflow during inhalation.\ne. The last 70% of ventricular filling is aided by the opening and closing of the semilunar valves.\nf. Ventricular filling is supplemented by the contraction of auxiliary heart chambers.\ng. Ventricular filling for the remaining 70% is regulated by hormonal changes during the cardiac cycle.\nh. Ventricular filling is achieved through nervous stimulation.\ni. Ventricular filling occurs during systole due to active flow.\nj.

The remaining 70% of ventricular filling is due to contraction of the atria.\n\nCorrect! The remaining 70% of ventricular filling is due to contraction of the atria. The atria contract during the cardiac cycle, which helps to fill the ventricles with blood.
