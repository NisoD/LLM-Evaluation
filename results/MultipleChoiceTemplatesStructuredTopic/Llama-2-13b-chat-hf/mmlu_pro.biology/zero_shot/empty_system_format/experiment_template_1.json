An ecological niche is the temperature range an organism prefers, and competitive exclusion means that species with the same temperature preferences cannot live in the same area. G. Niche is the set of behaviors an organism exhibits, and competitive exclusion implies that two species will eventually merge into one if they have similar behaviors. H.
