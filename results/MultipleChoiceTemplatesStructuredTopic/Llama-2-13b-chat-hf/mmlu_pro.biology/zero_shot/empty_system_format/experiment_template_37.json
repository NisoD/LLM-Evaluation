The nurse made a measurement error.\n\nExplanation: The nurse's measurement error is the most likely explanation for the different blood pressure readings in the arm and leg. Measurement errors can occur due to various factors, such as improper cuff size, incorrect placement of the cuff, or inadequate inflation of the cuff.
