Arms control strategies can be implemented, but deterrence strategies are impossible due to the anonymous nature of cyber attacks.\n\nExplanation:\n\nThe question asks about the effectiveness of arms control and deterrence strategies in cyber-security. The correct answer is option b, which states that arms control strategies can be implemented, but deterrence strategies are impossible due to the anonymous nature of cyber attacks.\n\nArms control strategies can be effective in cyber-security by limiting the development and deployment of certain types of cyber weapons, and by establishing norms and standards for their use. However, deterrence strategies are difficult to implement in cyber-security because it is difficult to attribute cyber attacks to specific actors, and because there is no clear mechanism", "MaxTokenProbability": "b", "Perplexity": 8.89, "GroundTruth": "d.
