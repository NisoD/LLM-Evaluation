One key difference is that the European school is based on a hegemonic form of knowledge, which emphasizes the understanding of causal mechanisms in relation to the material on which they act. In contrast, the problem-solving tradition in US political science is focused on finding solutions to specific policy problems.

Furthermore, the ability to retaliate can eliminate an opponent's potential gain.\nB. Deterrence has proved to have been a source of stabilization during the Cold War but proliferation pessimists contend that new states' development programs do not provide sufficient guarantees that the state sponsors will act as good custodians. Weak state structures might result in sabotage, accidental use, or even theft. There is also the problem of states developing technology under the guise of deterrence whilst having ulterior motives. Domestic pressures may result in a regime gravitating towards nuclear war fighting strategies to win a rapid victory and strengthen status.\nC.

Category B agents include food and water security threats, with moderate morbidity rates.\n\nExplanation: Category B agents, as defined by the US Centers for Disease Control, refer to diseases that pose a moderate threat to public health and national security. These agents can cause moderate morbidity rates and may have the potential to be used as biological weapons. Examples of Category B agents include food and water security threats, such as E. coli and Salmonella, which can cause illness and death in infected individuals. Other examples of Category B agents include diseases such as tularemia and brucellosis, which can be transmitted through contact with infected animals or contaminated food and water.

Choices: A. Biological agents comprise bacteria, viral, and toxin agents. However, not every disease provides the basis for an effective biological weapon. An agent's storage, delivery, mode of transmission and its very resilience can shape its effects on a target population.\nB. Construction of the means to transmit biological weapons in warfare has focused on the use of vectors, for example lice, fleas, or mosquitoes, as a mode of transmission as a military weapon. These are favoured because the target would find it difficult to contain the source of the outbreak, placing the infrastructure of the target country under strain.\nC. Military professionals believe that the majority of biological agents can be sufficiently stable in their effects to be used as a weapon. Resource requirements would be minimal as fermenters used to make vaccines could be converted for military production and relatively small quantities of the agent are required to produce highly lethal effects, making them an efficient and effective weapon.\nD. Inoculation programs against naturally occurring disease have eradicated the potential for viral agents to cause a global pandemic. Vaccination capabilities have undermined calls for the weaponization of viral agents made by some military strategists as most public health authorities have in place programs to deal with a possible outbreak.

Military professionals believe that the majority of biological agents can be sufficiently stable in their effects to be used as a weapon. This statement is true because many biological agents, such as bacteria and viruses, can be engineered to be highly stable and resistant to degradation, making them suitable for use as weapons. Additionally, the small size of these agents allows for easy transmission and dissemination, making them a potential threat to public health and safety.\n\nOption A is incorrect because it states that not every disease provides the basis for an effective biological weapon, which is not necessarily true.
