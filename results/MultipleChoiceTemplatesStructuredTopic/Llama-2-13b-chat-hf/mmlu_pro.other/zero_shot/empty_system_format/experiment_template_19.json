Yes, successful policies of arms control and deterrence have translated well from other security realms, such as nuclear weapons control strategies.\n\nExplanation:\n\nArms control and deterrence strategies have been effective in other security realms, such as nuclear weapons control, and can be applied to cyber-security as well. Arms control strategies can help regulate the development and use of cyber weapons, while deterrence strategies can help prevent cyber attacks by making the costs of such attacks unacceptably high.

The Sami, as the dominant group, have a higher level of influence and control over the diffusion process, and their adoption of reindeer herding sets the standard for other groups to follow.
