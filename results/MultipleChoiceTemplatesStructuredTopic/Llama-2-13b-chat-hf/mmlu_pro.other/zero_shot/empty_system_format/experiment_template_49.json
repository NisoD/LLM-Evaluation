It allowed the US to intensify its involvement in Vietnam.\n\nExplanation: The Gulf of Tonkin resolution, passed in 1964, granted President Lyndon B. Johnson broad authority to conduct military operations in Southeast Asia without a formal declaration of war. This resolution allowed the US to escalate its involvement in the Vietnam War, rather than curtailing it. The resolution led to a significant increase in US military presence and bombing campaigns in North Vietnam, which in turn led to a significant increase in US casualties and the length of the war.
