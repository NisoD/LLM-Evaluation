The Constitution, as originally drafted, did not include a bill of rights, and many state ratifying conventions conditioned their approval of the Constitution on the addition of such a bill.

Choices: I. Organized transnational crime groups are those structured groups randomly formed or otherwise but do not have a formally defined role for its members or continuity of membership but have a developed purpose for the intent of committing crimes. OR II. Transnational organized criminal activities consist of profit driven crime for a high level return that may result in the subversion or infiltration of the legal economy through the reinvestment of illicit profits.

Transnational criminal organizations are those organizations whose modes of operation result in breaking domestic laws, e.g. murder, theft or money-laundering, underlined by the employment of systematic violence.\n\nExplanation:\n\nThe concept of Transnational Criminal Organizations (TCOs) is a new and emerging concept in the field of criminal justice. It refers to groups or organizations that engage in criminal activities that transcend national borders and are characterized by systematic violence, murder, theft, and money-laundering. These organizations often have a hierarchical structure and are motivated by profit.\n\nThe correct answer is III, as it defines TCOs as organizations that engage in breaking domestic laws, such as murder, theft, and money-la", "MaxTokenProbability": "IV", "Perplexity": 16.09, "GroundTruth": "II.

Despite rejecting causality, constructivists simply replace the material trigger of causality with ideas.\n\nCorrect. This statement is not a valid criticism of constructivism. Constructivists do not reject causality altogether, but rather argue that the material conditions of the international system are shaped by ideas and norms. They do not simply replace material causes with ideas, but rather see ideas and norms as influencing the material conditions of the system.\n\nThis answer is correct because it accurately reflects the main tenets of constructivism. Constructivists do not deny the existence of material causes, but rather argue that ideas and norms play a crucial role in shaping the international system.

Choices: I. There is a developing scholarly trend toward proliferation pessimism, a pattern which has gained momentum rather than subsided with the end of the Cold War. There is concern that accidental war may occur, either through misperception, psychological or technical problems that can lead to spiralling tensions which result in a failure of deterrence policy. In addition, normal accidents resulting from the inability of a state to capably anticipate human-machine interactions in the complexities of the international (and anarchical) system may also occur. OR II. Proliferation optimists dispute the claim that nuclear technology leads to a propensity of the holding actor towards war. They do concede that there is the risk that terrorists acquiring the weapon could create an existential threat to the international system, although the threat is not yet a reality. Furthermore, the ability to retaliate can eliminate an opponent's potential gain. OR III. Despite the recognition that the ability to retaliate (the secure second-strike capability) produces a situation known as crisis stability, there is no consensus on the impact of nuclear capabilities, whether a source of stabilization or an existential threat. However there is agreement that the spread of WMD capacity to non-state actors would be fundamentally detrimental to international security based on the recognition that existing deterrence strategies and capabilities do not address the use of nuclear weapons. Indeed whilst the possibility exists, states will have to heighten security efforts. OR IV. Deterrence has proved to have been a source of stabilization during the Cold War but proliferation pessimists contend that new states' development programs do not provide sufficient guarantees that the state sponsors will act as good custodians. Weak state structures might result in sabotage, accidental use, or even theft. There is also the problem of states developing technology under the guise of deterrence whilst having ulterior motives.
