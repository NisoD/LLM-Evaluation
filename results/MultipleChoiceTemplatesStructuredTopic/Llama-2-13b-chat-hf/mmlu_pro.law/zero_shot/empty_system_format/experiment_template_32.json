The statute provides that such information must be written on the ballot in ink inan appropriate space. A write-in candidate is a German-American and is of the opinion that he needs a large turnout of German voters in order to win the election. As a result, his campaign manager decides to mail to every registered German voter a tear-off sticker, which bears the candidate's name and office for which he is running. Since many native German people are not proficient in reading and writing English, the campaign manager believes that many of the voters will have difficulty writing the candidate's name and office on the ballot. As a result, the campaign manager has mounted an extensive media campaign to inform voters on how to apply the stickers to the ballot. Five months prior to the election an election official notifies the candidate's campaign committee that the tear-off stickers do not comply with the state statute. In her letter, the official explains that state election officials are of the opinion that it is necessary for potential voters to write the candidate's name in ink. Therefore, she concludes that the stickers do not comply with statutory requirements. Three weeks later, the candidate filed suit in federal district court against state election officials, claiming that their interpretation of the state statute violates the U. S. Constitution. Which of the following sets forth the strongest constitutional argument the candidate could make against the interpretation of the statute by the state officials? Choices: 1.

The widower lived in a farmhouse on the lemon grove and used the property to raise produce. Adjoining the lemon grove directly to the west was a 10-acre farm that was owned in fee simple by a farmer. There was a four-lane highway that adjoined the lemon grove directly to the east. The widower, by way of gift, executed a deed naming his daughter as grantee. The deed granted to the daughter and her heirs an antebellum mansion located near the southern edge of the lemon grove. The antebellum mansion was accessible by a little- used road that ran west to east from the farmlgrove border to the four-lane highway along the southern boundary of the grove. The daughter recorded her deed and took immediate possession of the property. A short while later, the daughter and the farmer fell in love and began seeing each other quite frequently. In order for the farmer to reach the daughter's house, it was necessary for him to travel over the little-used road across the lemon grove. Many years later, the farmer, who was still having an affair with the daughter, met her father at a Rotary Club meeting. They struck up a conversation, and the widower asked the farmer, \"Have you been driving your pickup along that little-used back road on my property?\" The farmer, who was afraid to tell the widower about his love affair with the daughter, responded with a half-truth, \"Yes, I've been using it as a shortcut to the four-lane highway. \" Unaware that the farmer was also using the path to get to the antebellum mansion to see the daughter, the widower said, \"No problem, I just wanted to be sure that it was you who was using the road. \"Thereafter, the widower found out about his daughter's relationship with the farmer.

Will the court enforce the lien of the mortgagee against the sale of the property by the surviving second cousin? Choices: 1. Yes, because the second cousin's assent to the judgment lien was presumed by law and that assent destroyed the joint tenancy., 2.

Will the appellate court likely rule that the landowner can assert rights to stop the attempted transfer? Choices: 1. Yes, eminent domain is restricted to taking property that is urgently needed for a public use and the failure to use it for that purpose defeated fee simple ownership in the agency., 2.

The woman devised a scheme whereby she would contaminate her husband's guacamole with a poisonous substance called strychnine. To facilitate her plan, she enlisted the help of her boyfriend. At first, the boyfriend adamantly refused to go along with her scheme, but when the woman threatened to break off their relationship, he reluctantly agreed. The boyfriend, a pre-med student, got the strychnine from the pharmacy by telling them that he was using it for an experiment with rats. The boyfriend then gave the strychnine to the woman, who sprinkled it in her husband's guacamole. The husband died from the poisoning.

Answer:\n", "Result": "\nCorrect Answer: 4. recover, if the hiker feared for his life.\n\nExplanation:\n\nThe hiker asserts a claim for assault against the hunter. To prove assault, the hiker must show that the hunter intentionally acted in a way that created a reasonable fear of imminent harm. In this case, the hunter's actions of turning with a rifle pointed in the hiker's direction would likely create a reasonable fear of imminent harm, especially if the hiker felt sure that he was going to get shot.\n\nThe fact that the gun did not go off is not relevant to the assessment of whether an assault occurred.

In 2006, a farmer purchased the orange grove, a 10-acre tract, in fee simple absolute. The vineyard, a 20-acre tract situated to the north of the orange grove, was owned by a rancher in fee simple absolute. A remote predecessor of the farmer had granted to a shepherd a way for egress and ingress across the orange grove under such terms and circumstances that an easement appurtenant to the vineyard was created. This right-of-way was executed by deed and properly recorded. The shepherd, however, never made any actual use of the right-of-way. In 2010, the rancher conveyed the vineyard to the farmer.

Neither the rancher \u0080\u0094farmer deed nor the farmer \u0080\u0094 investor deed contained any reference to the easement for right-of-way.

The so-called installment land contract has been popular as a substitute for the mortgage or deed of trust. Under such a contract, the seller agrees to accept, and the buyer agrees to pay, the purchase price in installments over a stipulated period of time. The vendor retains legal title as security for the payment of the purchase price; and the vendee has equitable title under the doctrine of equitable conversion. The most important characteristic of the installment land contract, however, is the forfeiture clause, which provides that if the vendee is in default for 30 days, the vendor may, at his option, declare a forfeiture of the contract, in which case all payments made shall be forfeited as \"liquidated\" damages and the buyer shall become a tenant at will of the seller. Over the years, many sellers of property under such installment land contracts have declared forfeitures in situations where the prospective buyers were delinquent in their payments, even when the buyer was late with a single payment after nearly all the other payments had been made. In order to remedy this inequitable situation, the state legislature enacted a statute requiring any seller attempting to declare a forfeiture of an installment land contract to do so by instituting a formal foreclosure action in the courts. The new law also provided that prior to the commencement of such a foreclosure action, the seller under such an arrangement must give the buyer a 60-day grace period to make up any delinquent installment payment with interest. The new law expressly applied both to installment land contracts entered into subsequent to its enactment and to installment land contracts already in existence at the time of its enactment. Is this new state statute likely to be held constitutional? Choices: 1. No, because application of the law to installment land contracts entered into before or after its enactment is a deprivation of a proprietary interest without due process of the law., 2.

The doctor indicated that he would meet them there. A short time later at the hospital, the doctor treated the father and bandaged his hand. However, due to the fact that the father had lost a considerable amount of blood, the doctor ordered an immediate blood transfusion.

The person in the blood bank who received the nurse's call correctly wrote down the order for A-positive blood. However, someone working at the blood bank, whose identity cannot be determined, made an error in filling the order and labeling the unit of blood for the father.

At the strip club, they paid for private dances and attempted to have conversations with the women. As hard as they tried, the women who worked in the club did not seem as interested in the brothers as they were in the women. As the night wore on, the brothers decided that they would wait behind the club until closing for the women to come out. The victim, who had given a dance to one of the brothers, came out and proceeded to walk to her car. One of the brothers grabbed the victim from behind and pulled her to the ground while the other brother sexually assaulted her. Both brothers were arrested and charged with the rape of the victim.

He raised $1 million from various sources to fund the project. After searching for a vacant lot that would be sufficient for development, the developer concluded that there was not a suitable vacant lot available. Reluctantly, the developer concluded that he would have to purchase a developed lot, have the existing structures removed, and then build the apartment house. The developer was reluctant to do this, because he had not budgeted for the additional cost of buying a developed property and removing the development. After a search for an appropriate parcel, the developer purchased a large lot, developed with a single-story residential home, for $200,000. He then spent $50,000 having the residential home removed from the lot. Knowing that it would cost approximately $850,000 to build the apartment house, the developer realized he would need to raise another $100,000. He approached an investor about lending him $100,000. The investor was apprehensive about the project because the developer had not yet lined up a construction firm to build the apartment house. As a result, the parties signed the following written agreement:\"The investor promises to lend to the developer $100,000 at 5 percent interest within 30 days, provided the developer contracts with a construction company to build the apartment house for no more than $850,000.

They had been employed by the casino for four years. One day, they were unexpectedly fired by the casino's new manager. Apparently, the casino hired the new manager to get rid of some of the old-time employees and replace them with new personnel at a lower wage. Angered by their firing, the codefendants vowed to get back at the casino. As their revenge, they decided to plant a bomb in the casino and demand $1,000,000. After receiving the money, they would then reveal the location of the bomb and provide details for defusing it. The co-defendants agreed that the casino should be given adequate warning so that nobody would be injured. In accordance with their plan, one of the co-defendants, who was an electronics expert, built the bomb himself. He alone then drove to the casino where he placed the bomb in a hallway closet. Shortly thereafter, the other co-defendant phoned the casino and made a demand for the money. He said a bomb was in the casino and that it would explode in 24 hours unless the money was paid. The casino treated their demand as a crank call and refused to make any payment. With their plans having gone awry, the codefendants agreed that one of them should return to the casino and defuse the bomb. As one of the co-defendants was driving back to the casino, the bomb exploded, killing 30 people. A subsequent investigation revealed that a faulty wire caused the bomb to detonate prematurely.

Although it is not the only lake in the county, it is the largest and most scenic, and it attracts visitors from miles around. One of its biggest assets is the excellent fishing and boating, which is available to the public at large. Three years ago, in order to enhance the recreational aspects of the lake, the county leased a sizable portion of the lake and surrounding parkland to a company owned by the most prominent family in the county. The lease required the company to construct and operate a first-rate yacht house and club, complete with bar, restaurant, and private marina, and to pay the county 10% of its net profits as rent. The company set up bylaws, which were reviewed and approved by the county at the time the lease was negotiated. According to the bylaws, the yacht club, complete with its restaurant and bar, would be open to members only, and the membership committee was empowered to set up strict membership \"standards,\" as well as the cost of membership fees and dues. Upon completion of the facilities, the state granted the company a license to sell alcoholic beverages in its restaurant and bar. The membership committee announced that the membership fee was $5,000 and the monthly dues $75. Furthermore, the membership committee had a policy of approving only membership applications from men, while disapproving and denying all applications from women. There were other similar facilities within the county available to women. A woman resident of the county brings suit against the company, claiming that her membership application was denied only because she is a woman, and that its policy of excluding women as a group denies her equal protection rights.

In preparing for the bar examination, the graduate planned to take a bar review course. Although she had not pre-enrolled, the graduate planned to attend and pay for the course at registration. On the morning the course was set to begin, the graduate arrived late after getting stuck in freeway traffic. By the time the graduate got to the course location, registration had already been completed. When the graduate looked into the room where the course was being conducted, she saw the lecture had begun, and everyone was inside busily taking notes. Panicky, the graduate picked up a set of course materials that were lying on the registration table and entered without paying. Although the graduate intended to pay the enrollment fee, no one was at the registration table to take her money.

Unbeknownst to the graduate, the bar review course's regional director noticed that she had entered the lectures without paying.

The president of a development company is interested in purchasing three of the four parcels. The president buys the three parcels from the farmer and begins formulating plans for constructing single-family dwelling units on the land. The original deed between the farmer and the development company contains a provision expressly binding \"upon all subsequent grantees, their heirs, and assigns,\" stipulating that any further subdivisions by any such persons shall be restricted to minimum two-acre lots to be used for single- family dwelling units only. The development company immediately subdivided two of the parcels into lots of three, four, and five acres, and began construction of homes thereon. The original deed restrictions were enumerated within the special warranty deeds and were given to the purchasers of the homes in the new development, called phase 1. Two years later, the president sold the remaining parcel, which had not been included in the phase 1 subdivision plan, to a contractor. The contractor, in turn, drafted a subdivision plan for the last 250-acre parcel, dividing it into one-acre lots. The contractor then commenced construction of single-family dwelling units in the new development, to be known as phase 2. There was no mention of the restriction for two-acre minimum lots in the deeds to the purchasers of the new homes in phase 2. Meanwhile, after the farmer's death, his estate isrequired to sell the remaining 250-acre parcel of his farmland.

While in prison, federal authorities began investigating the murder of the defendant's 11-year- old stepdaughter who was murdered two years earlier. Believing that the defendant was responsible for this killing, federal agents decided to plant an informant at the prison to befriend the defendant and possibly obtain evidence about the crime. In accord with this plan, the federal agents hired a paid informant and placed him in the prison as a fellow inmate, masquerading as an organized crime figure. The informant soon befriended the defendant and learned that he was being threatened by other inmates because of a rumor that he had killed a child. The informant then raised the subject in several conversations, but the defendant repeatedly denied any such involvement. After the defendant started receiving tough treatment from other inmates because of the rumor, the informant offered to protect the defendant but told him, \"You have to tell me the truth about what really happened you know, if you want me to help you. \" Believing that the informant would protect him from the other inmates, the defendant then admitted to the informant that he had driven his stepdaughter to the desert where he killed her.

The rental agreement provided that the land was to be used as farmland. Shortly after the tenant took possession of the tract of land, he built thereon, at his own expense, a barn made of lumber, which was 15 feet wide, 20 feet long, and set on loose bricks. The barn increased the appraised market value of the tract of land from $250,000 to $275,000. The tenant then began farming operations on the land. Toward the end of the lease period, the owner informed the tenant that he was going to put the tract of land up for sale. The next month, when the lease expired, the parties settled a dispute over the tenant's right, if any, to compensation for the improvements by the following written agreement:\"On the sale of the tract of land, the owner hereby agrees to pay the tenant two-thirds of any sale proceeds in excess of $250,000, provided that tenant may remain on the farm for the next year, rent-free, while the owner tries to sell it. After that time, the tenant may remain on the land until closing of the sale, at a monthly rental of $1,000. \"The owner initially set the asking price at $300,000. After receiving scant interest, the owner decided to reduce the price to $260,000. This price reduction so infuriated the tenant that he thereafter made negative comments about the farm to all of the prospective buyers. Finally, 14 months after the agreement between the owner and the tenant was executed, and after rejecting offers for $240,000 and $250,000, the owner sold the tract of land for $256,000 to a buyer who visited the land while the tenant was away on vacation. Thereupon, the tenant, who had failed to pay the last two months rent as per the agreement, moved out. After closing, the owner refused to pay the tenant any of the sale proceeds, and the tenant brought suit to recover damages for breach of contract. Which of the following is the owner's most persuasive argument in defense of the tenant's suit? Choices: 1. The tenant committed an uncured material breach of an implied promise to cooperate in the owner's efforts to sell the property, or at least not to hinder the proposed sale., 2. The owner's decision to reduce the asking price without consulting the tenant was a breach of their agreement., 3. The agreement between the owner and the tenant was voidable because it was a restraint on alienation, since it conditioned a promise to pay for a conveyance of land upon an otherwise invalid leasehold contract., 4.

The rental agreement provided that the land was to be used as farmland. Shortly after the tenant took possession of the tract of land, he built thereon, at his own expense, a barn made of lumber, which was 15 feet wide, 20 feet long, and set on loose bricks. The barn increased the appraised market value of the tract of land from $250,000 to $275,000. The tenant then began farming operations on the land. Toward the end of the lease period, the owner informed the tenant that he was going to put the tract of land up for sale. The next month, when the lease expired, the parties settled a dispute over the tenant's right, if any, to compensation for the improvements by the following written agreement:\"On the sale of the tract of land, the owner hereby agrees to pay the tenant two-thirds of any sale proceeds in excess of $250,000, provided that tenant may remain on the farm for the next year, rent-free, while the owner tries to sell it. After that time, the tenant may remain on the land until closing of the sale, at a monthly rental of $1,000. \"The owner initially set the asking price at $300,000. After receiving scant interest, the owner decided to reduce the price to $260,000. This price reduction so infuriated the tenant that he thereafter made negative comments about the farm to all of the prospective buyers. Finally, 14 months after the agreement between the owner and the tenant was executed, and after rejecting offers for $240,000 and $250,000, the owner sold the tract of land for $256,000 to a buyer who visited the land while the tenant was away on vacation. Thereupon, the tenant, who had failed to pay the last two months rent as per the agreement, moved out. After closing, the owner refused to pay the tenant any of the sale proceeds, and the tenant brought suit to recover damages for breach of contract. Which of the following is the owner's most persuasive argument in defense of the tenant's suit? Choices: 1. The tenant committed an uncured material breach of an implied promise to cooperate in the owner's efforts to sell the property, or at least not to hinder the proposed sale., 2. The owner's decision to reduce the asking price without consulting the tenant was a breach of their agreement., 3. The agreement between the owner and the tenant was voidable because it was a restraint on alienation, since it conditioned a promise to pay for a conveyance of land upon an otherwise invalid leasehold contract., 4. The tenant failed to maintain the property in a presentable state for potential buyers, thereby breaching his responsibilities under the agreement., 5. The tenant's failure to pay any rent for the last two months was a material breach of contract that discharged the owner's remaining duties of performance., 6.

She had called their landline number to talk with her sister on the same day when he had first reported to the police that his fianc\u00c3\u00a9 had been missing for five days. The sister had not met the man but had spoken with him briefly a few other times. He told her that her sister \"went out all night last night and did not return yet.\" The prosecution attempted at trial to have the sister testify to the conversation to show the significant discrepancy between his stories to the police and to her. The defense objected, arguing that she couldn't authenticate the conversation because she couldn't identify the speaker as the defendant nor had she ever met him. The prosecution told the court that she felt it was \"probably\" his voice, which she recollected from the prior talks at the same number.

The nephew and the agent entered into a valid written contract whereby the agent promised to undertake best efforts to find a buyer for the parcel. The contract also provided that the agent was to be paid a commission of 5 percent on the gross sale price following the consummation of the sale and transfer of title. The agent succeeded in finding a buyer for the parcel. The agent notified the nephew that he had found a developer who wanted to purchase the parcel for $500,000.

In order to facilitate the access to the cottage, the chef entered into an agreement with a neighbor, an adjoining land owner, whereby the neighbor, in writing, granted the chef a right-of-way over a strip of land 30 feet in width and a quarter of a mile in length along the eastern margin of the neighbor's property. Without notifying the neighbor, the chef proceeded to improve the roadbed by having the road asphalted in order to make it more accessible for motor vehicle traffic. Several years later, the neighbor started a sand business, which required him to do heavy hauling that subsequently destroyed the asphalted surface on the road. Ten years after the neighbor started his sand business, the chef sold his lakefront property to his assistant. Shortly after the assistant took possession of the cottage and property, the neighbor erected wooden barriers across the roadway, thus obstructing the access to the assistant's property. The assistant's strongest argument in an action against the neighbor for removal of the barriers, which are obstructing his access to the property, would be that Choices: 1. the neighbor's sand business constitutes a misuse of the easement., 2. the chef's improvements to the roadbed grant him additional rights to the easement., 3. the chef and the assistant, being in privity of estate, could \"tack on\" their successive use periods., 4. an easement appurtenant is alienable in that any conveyance transferring possession of the dominant tenement also passes the easement privilege., 5. the assistant, as a bonafide purchaser, is protected from the neighbor's obstruction, even though the easement was unrecorded., 6. because the easement was created by implication, the chef's prior and continuous use gave rise to a prescriptive easement., 7. the assistant has a legal right to improve the easement for his own use., 8. the assistant is entitled to compensation for the damage caused by the neighbor's sand business., 9. the assistant can claim ownership of the easement due to his long-term use of the property.

During their stay at Yellowstone, the family camped out in a secluded area of the campgrounds surrounded by tall pine trees. Numerous signs had been posted throughout the campgrounds warning campers of the extremely dry conditions prevailing in the forest area due to a summerlong drought. On the morning of their departure, the family cooked breakfast over an open campfire. After breakfast, the family began to pack their gear into the van when the father instructed his 12-year-old son to put out the campfire. The son fetched two pails of water from a nearby pond and tossed the water over the campfire. Believing that he had extinguished the fire, the son joined his family in the van, and they drove away. Unbeknownst to the son and his family, the campfire was still smoldering when they left. Shortly thereafter, a wind gust blew the flames from the fire to some nearby brush. Due to the extremely dry conditions, the brush quickly ignited, starting a raging forest fire. The forest rangers dispatched a firefighting team, which included two helicopters equipped to fight the fire. While these helicopters were fighting the blaze from above, the smoke \u0080\u00a2 surrounding one of the helicopters became so intense that the pilot lost all visibility.

Located below the ranch is an estate that is owned by a millionaire. A stream is a non-navigable watercourse that originates at the top of the mountain and runs all the way down into a valley. Both the ranch and the estate are within the watershed of the stream. When the millionaire purchased the estate in 1956, he started taking water from the stream and used it to irrigate the southern half of his property, which he has used as a farm. Prior to 1956, the southern half of the estate had been cleared and placed in cultivation, while the northern half remained wooded and virtually unused. The millionaire continued this established pattern of use and has never stopped using the water in this way. In 1986, the rancher built a home on the ranch and started talcing water from the stream for domestic purposes. During that year there was heavy rainfall, and this caused the stream to run down the mountain at a high water level. However, in 1987, a drought caused the stream to flow at a very low level. Consequently, there was only enough water to irrigate the millionaire's farmland or, in the alternative, to supply all of the rancher's domestic water needs and one-quarter of the millionaire's irrigation requirements. The mountain is located in a jurisdiction where the period of prescription is 15 years. The rancher is continuing to take water for his personal needs and there is insufficient water to irrigate the estate.

He put his name on the mailbox and has paid the taxes and maintenance expenses. To earn extra money, the best friend rented a small house on the property to a teacher and received a monthly rental payment from her.

The contractor was guilty of undue delay in getting the bridge construction finished. The contract had a liquidated damages clause that provided for a deduction from the contract price for each day of delay in completing the bridge. The formula for the deductions from the contract price was based on how much traffic flow was turned away. The city tried to deduct the damages from the contract price. The contractor, however, pointed out that the city had not yet connected a road to the bridge so that there was no traffic flow and hence no damage to the city. Will the court uphold the liquidated damages clause in favor of the city? Choices: 1. No, because the city has not suffered any loss due to the delay as there was no traffic flow., 2.

After approving the license to the utility company, the city council then passed a measure by which the utility company was required to insert in its monthly billing statements a letter from a private consumer group criticizing the high cost of electrical service. The cost of printing and mailing the monthly letter was paid entirely by the consumer group.

Her garden had become a showplace for the neighborhood, and various civic groups and organizations frequently visited the woman's property to enjoy the beauty of the yard. Recently, the woman had read about a particular cymbidium that was native to Japan. Desiring to have one of these cymbidiums planted in her garden, she contacted a number of plant distributors, only to discover that this particular cymbidium had not yet been imported to the United States. She contacted a plant distributor, who she knew had ties to Japan, and asked if it would be possible to acquire one of these cymbidiums from Japan. After checking with local and Japanese authorities, the distributor determined that he could indeed acquire the plant for the woman. The parties then signed a contract that stated the distributor would acquire the cymbidium from a nursery in Japan, have it shipped to the United States and have it planted in the woman's garden for the price of $5,000. The distributor promised that the plant would be in place within six months, and the woman promised to pay $1,000 at the time of the execution of the contract and$4,000 when the cymbidium was planted in her garden. The woman then handed a check for $1,000 to the distributor. Two weeks later, agricultural officials discovered that a special type of beetle that attacked citrus plants had adapted to using cymbidiums for nesting purposes. The female beetle would lay eggs among the roots of the cymbidiums, and it would sometimes take up to one year for the eggs to hatch. Fearing for the safety of the citrus crops in the United States, the United States government adopted a ban on the importation of all cymbidiums grown in foreign countries.

One afternoon, the woman was in the kitchen of her home preparing a snack when she glanced out the window and saw a horrible crime being committed. The woman watched in horror as a local gang member pulled out a handgun and used it to shoot the victim, a member of a rival gang.

After exploding, the aerial bomb emits a spectacular rainbow fireworks display that is seen for miles around. One afternoon, a 10-year-old boy and a few friends went to the fairgrounds to see the circus. After paying their admission, they were about to enter the \"big top\" when the boy came upon an aerial bomb lying on the ground. Ignorant of what the object really was, but in an exploratory mood, the boy applied a match to the fuse of the fireworks device. It exploded and seriously injured the boy. After the accident, and before the parents of the boy had retained a lawyer, the adjuster for the circus's insurance carrier contacted the parents several times, trying to negotiate a settlement of their claim against the circus. On each occasion, the adjuster told the parents there was no need for them to hire an attorney because the applicable civil code did not provide for recovery in such a situation. The adjuster was aware that this information was blatantly false. He also warned the parents that unless they accepted his offered settlement of $5,000, they would receive nothing. For over a month, the adjuster continued to harass the parents. Outraged by the adjuster's actions, the parents sought the advice of a neighbor who recommended that they consult an attorney.

The belt replacement was not listed as work to be performed in the written contract. The mechanic telephoned the woman and told her he had found the worn belt and felt he should replace it. The woman told him to do so.

The ordinance expressly exempted from its purview the singing or chanting of religious songs.

The art collector is obligated to sell the woman the painting for $10,000, because the woman, as offeree, had the right to accept the initial offer within the 30-day period., 4. The art collector is obligated to sell the painting for $10,000 as the woman accepted the original offer before it was revoked., 5. The woman is obligated to pay the art collector $10,000, because the art collector did not properly revoke the initial offer., 6. Since the parties entered into a subsequent modification, the woman is obligated to pay the art collector $15,000 for the painting., 7. The woman is not obligated to pay any amount, because the initial offer was not legally binding., 8. The woman is obligated to pay $15,000, because she agreed to this price during their telephone conversation on April 10., 9. The woman is obligated to pay $15,000 as the new agreement made on April 10 supersedes the initial offer., 10.

There has been considerable concern among state health officials who foresee that many of the senior citizens will become victims of price gouging on certain medical supplies and services. In an attempt to curb such fraudulent sales practices, the state legislature has enacted a law prohibiting the sale of hearing aids by non-physicians. The measure provides, however, that all non-physician sellers who are presently engaged in the business of selling hearing aids will not be affected. Assume that after the statute goes into effect, a non-physician moves to the state and wants to open a business selling hearing aids. After being advised that the state law prohibits him from doing so, he brings suit challenging the constitutionality of the statute. The most likely result is that the state law will be declared Choices: 1. unconstitutional, because it violates the commerce clause, since Congress has plenary power to regulate any activity that has any appreciable effect on interstate commerce., 2. unconstitutional, because it creates an unfair trade barrier for non-physicians wanting to start a business in the state., 3. constitutional, as it aims to protect a vulnerable segment of the population from potential exploitation., 4. constitutional, because there is a rational basis for distinguishing between non-physicians are not so engaged., 5. unconstitutional, because it discriminates between non-physicians already in the business and those wanting to enter it., 6. unconstitutional, because it restricts the rights of non-physicians to conduct a legitimate business., 7. constitutional, because it falls under the state's power to regulate healthcare and related services., 8. constitutional, because it does not infringe upon the rights of non-physicians not already in the business of selling hearing aids., 9. constitutional, because a state has the power to regulate any phase of local business, even though such regulations may have some effect on interstate commerce, provided that Congress has not enacted legislation regarding the subject matter.

The mother is legally separated from her husband and has filed for divorce. The mother and her husband own their home in joint tenancy. One night, the mother went out to dinner and left her daughter at home. Upon leaving the house, the mother locked the door to her bedroom. While the mother was gone, the daughter found a spare key to her mother's bedroom and opened the door. While rummaging through her mother's dresser, she found a bag containing white powder. Concerned that the bag might contain drugs, the daughter called her father to ask his advice. The husband instructed her to call the police. The daughter then telephoned the police station and reported what she had found. A patrol car was immediately dispatched to her home. The daughter allowed the police to come inside and led them to her mother's bedroom. She gave the officers the bag, which they took to the station house for a lab test.

The ski lift company had installed and operated the lift pursuant to a concession agreement with the owner of the private park. Visitors gained entry to the park on payment of a $5 fee, which entitled them to go ice skating, tobogganing, or sledding. A ski lift ticket cost an additional $7 per day. At the top of the ski lift, there was a platform for embarking and disembarking passengers. The ski lift company paid the owner a stipulated rental plus 15 percent of the net proceeds from the lift. Two employees of the company operated the lift, one from a station at the bottom and the other from a station at the top of the hill. When the vacationer boarded the ski lift, it was late afternoon and most of the skiers had left. He was the sole passenger on the lift. Meanwhile, the employee at the top had left his post to go to the bathroom, asking his friend to keep watch on the lift and to stop it to allow any passengers to disembark. The friend consented, and the employee showed him how to use the control switch. When the vacationer approached the top, the employee was still away. Instead of stopping the lift to permit the vacationer to get off, the friend allowed the lift to keep moving. The vacationer was carried past the platform, and he was swung violently from side to side as the ski lift started downward.

The state's economy used to be based solely on heavy industry. However, the state legislature approved legalized gambling within the state. As a consequence, many casinos and new hotels were built and the state's economy boomed. These moves were often induced by the granting by the state of special tax benefits for the construction of new casinos and hotels under state statutes. Recently, however, neighboring states have legalized gambling and offered greater tax incentives to the gaming industry. As a result, many of the casino and hotel owners have begun to leave the state. The unemployment and social welfare benefits the state has had to pay have substantially increased, burdening the remaining casinos, and also making it difficult for the state to lower its taxes to remain competitive with other states. On account of this predicament, the state legislature passed, and the governor duly signed, an emergency bill into law. According to the statute, the state imposed a one cent tax on the playing of any slot machine in any gambling casino. Since virtually all the slot machines required a payment of either a dime, quarter, or dollar, the imposition of this tax required a major costly adaptation on each slot machine to allow for the deposit of the additional one cent tax. Although many casino owners have complained about the tax, their only alternative is to absorb the tax themselves and lose one cent per game. As a consequence of the tax, fewer slot machines are purchased in the state by the casino owners. No manufacturer of slot machines is located in the state. Which of the following constitutional provisions provide the strongest ground to attack the validity of the state tax bill? Choices: 1. The full faith and credit clause of Article IV, Section 1., 2.

Additionally, the tax may be deemed to be an unconstitutional burden on interstate commerce, as it affects the gaming industry, which is a significant source of revenue for the state.\n\nThe other constitutional provisions listed do not provide a strong ground to attack the validity of the state tax bill.

In addition, the rancher installed electrical wiring on the fence. The wiring transmitted an electric current, which would emit a shock upon contact with the fence.

All the basketball players on the school team, except the teenager, signed the authorization. In the third game of the season, the team beat their archrival, and the teenager scored a record high 69 points. In the locker room following the game, the basketball coach approached the teenager and requested that he provide a urine sample for a random drug test. The teenager refused. He had smoked some marijuana the previous day and was afraid that a positive test result might jeopardize his being awarded a basketball scholarship to college.

The student believed that he was committing a crime by flashing himself in front of the co-eds. In this jurisdiction, it is a felony to flash or expose oneself in the nude, so, unknown to the student, what he was doing was not a crime.

The defendant's attorney argued that the briefcase did not belong to the defendant, and the defendant had no idea how the heroin got inside the briefcase. The court ruled that there was insufficient probable cause to support a prosecution of the defendant on the heroin possession charge. The defendant was released from custody and charges were dropped.

In 2000, the railroad decided to discontinue operating its trains over the strip conveyed in 1955. By 2004, the growth of a nearby town had made the 300-acre cattle ranch valuable as a potential site for homes or for an industrial park. However, as of January 1, 2005, the governing body of the county (in which the ranch sits) took appropriate action, in accordance with Texas statutes, to zone the 300-acre cattle ranch as single-family residential property with a minimum lot size of one acre.

The Constitution grants Congress the power to regulate commerce with foreign nations, among the states, and with Indian tribes. This power includes the authority to regulate the movement of people and goods on the nation's highways, including Pennsylvania Avenue.

The statute provides that such information must be written on the ballot in ink in an appropriate space. A write-in candidate for the office of Attorney General is a Chinese-American. The candidate is of the opinion that he needs a large turnout of Chinese voters in order to win the election. As a result, his campaign manager decides to mail to every registered Chinese voter a tear-off sticker, which bears the candidates name along with the office of Attorney General. Since many native Chinese people are not proficient in reading and writing English, the campaign manager believes that many of the voters will have difficulty writing the candidate's name and office on the ballot. As a result, the campaign manager has mounted an extensive media campaign to inform voters on how to apply the stickers to the ballot. Five months prior to the election an election official notifies the candidate's campaign committee that the tear-off stickers do not comply with the state statute. In her letter, the official explains that state election officials are of the opinion that it is necessary for potential voters to write the candidate's name in ink. Therefore, she concludes that the stickers do not comply with statutory requirements. Three weeks later, the candidate filed suit in federal district court against the election officials, claiming that their interpretation of the state statute violates the U. S. Constitution. Thereafter, one of the candidate's opponents filed suit in state court seeking to prevent state election officials from counting any write-in ballots with stickers. The state court has now scheduled a prompt hearing on this matter. In addition, the state court has indicated that it hopes to render a decision on the merits within the next three weeks.

The surgeon was assisted by an intern, who was assigned to the operation by the hospital, and a nurse, who was on the staff of the hospital. During the patient's convalescence, the patient complained of pain not explicable as an ordinary post-operative symptom. On investigation, it turned out that the intern and nurse, who had worked together in bandaging him, had done so in such a way as to constrict certain blood vessels. The faulty bandaging had caused acute pain and retarded the patient's recovery. After the patient's eventual recovery, he sued the intern, claiming $20,000 in damages. Before the case went to trial, the patient and intern agreed to a settlement in which the intern paid the patient $12,000, and the patient released the intern from all further claims for liability arising out of the incident.
