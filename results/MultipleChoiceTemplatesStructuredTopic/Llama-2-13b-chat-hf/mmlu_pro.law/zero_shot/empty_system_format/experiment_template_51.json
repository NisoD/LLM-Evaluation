The statute provides that such information must be written on the ballot in ink inan appropriate space. A write-in candidate is a German-American and is of the opinion that he needs a large turnout of German voters in order to win the election. As a result, his campaign manager decides to mail to every registered German voter a tear-off sticker, which bears the candidate's name and office for which he is running. Since many native German people are not proficient in reading and writing English, the campaign manager believes that many of the voters will have difficulty writing the candidate's name and office on the ballot. As a result, the campaign manager has mounted an extensive media campaign to inform voters on how to apply the stickers to the ballot. Five months prior to the election an election official notifies the candidate's campaign committee that the tear-off stickers do not comply with the state statute. In her letter, the official explains that state election officials are of the opinion that it is necessary for potential voters to write the candidate's name in ink. Therefore, she concludes that the stickers do not comply with statutory requirements. Three weeks later, the candidate filed suit in federal district court against state election officials, claiming that their interpretation of the state statute violates the U. S. Constitution.

The daughter recorded her deed and took immediate possession of the property. A short while later, the daughter and the farmer fell in love and began seeing each other quite frequently. In order for the farmer to reach the daughter's house, it was necessary for him to travel over the little-used road across the lemon grove.

The first cousin put up his interest in the joint tenancy as security for a $20,000 loan and signed a judgment note. It was later entered as a judgment against the first cousin's interest in the real estate. The first cousin died a year later. The second cousin decided to sell the property, but the mortgagee filed an action to prevent the sale and to enforce his interest in the property. The second cousin defended on the basis that any lien on the first cousin's interest in the property was extinguished on the first cousin's death. Will the court enforce the lien of the mortgagee against the sale of the property by the surviving second cousin? Choices: I. No, because a joint tenant cannot legally file a judgment note on just that joint tenant's interest because it would be an unconstitutional interference with the other's property rights. | II. No, because when the first cousin died the second cousin became the sole owner due to the right of survivorship, as per the joint tenancy which was still fully intact. | III.

Thereafter, the fan received a contract from the club, which all baseball camp attendees were required to sign. The agreement provided that the $2,500 entrance fee was nonrefundable. According to the agreement, all attendees would receive group instruction during the baseball camp. Consequently, the club's operating costs would not be reduced if one or more of the attendees failed to participate or complete the two-week program. The fan signed the contract and forwarded it with his $2,500 entrance fee to the club. Two days before the start of the baseball camp, however, the fan died from a heart attack. In a restitutionary action, can the executor of the fan's estate, a surviving brother, recover on behalf of the estate either all or part of the $2,500 paid to the club? Choices: I. Yes, because the club did not incur any cost related to the fan's participation. | II. Yes, if the club can fill the spot with another attendee. | III. Yes, because the club would otherwise be unjustly enriched at the fan's expense. | IV. No, because under the terms of the agreement the $2,500 entrance fee was nonrefundable. | V. No, but only if the club can show that before the start of the baseball camp it rejected another applicant because of its commitment to the fan. | VI. No, because the club had already invested in resources for the camp. | VII. No, because the fan's death was not the club's responsibility. | VIII.

The man with the box reached the edge of the platform, next to the train, just as the train started to move. The man hesitated, unsure of whether he should give up or go ahead and jump onto the train even though it was moving. A railroad worker, who happened to be standing next to the train, decided to be helpful. He said, \"You can make it,\" and gave the man a shove toward the open door of the train. The man stumbled and dropped the box that he was carrying. Instantly, the box made a loud screeching noise. The box contained powerful fireworks, and the impact of the box hitting the ground had caused a large rocket to ignite.

A wide variety of frogs, turtles, snakes, birds, and other animals inhabited the yard. The ground was usually covered by several inches of standing water. The environmentalist's neighbors were not pleased with the condition of the environmentalist's yard. They complained that it produced foul odors, and they claimed that the standing water was a breeding ground for mosquitoes and other insects. Several months after the environmentalist converted his yard into a marsh, a real estate investor purchased the house closest to the environmentalist's back yard swamp. The investor lived in a large city several hundred miles away, and he purchased the house next to the environmentalist's for investment purposes. The investor rented the house to a family under a long-term lease. The tenant family complained frequently to the investor about being annoyed by the environmentalist's yard. If the investor asserts a nuisance claim against the environmentalist, the environmentalist's best defense would be Choices: I. that the investor has not shown that the marsh has negatively affected the value of his property. | II. that turning his yard into a swampy marsh did not violate any zoning ordinance. | III. that the investor failed to conduct a proper inspection of the property and surrounding area before purchasing the house. | IV. that he had sound environmental reasons for maintaining the swampy condition of his yard. | V. that the environmentalist has a right to use his property as he sees fit, as long as it does not harm others. | VI. that the swampy condition of his yard attracts a variety of wildlife, which increases biodiversity. | VII. that the environmentalist's yard is actually beneficial to the community by providing a natural habitat for local wildlife. | VIII. that when the investor purchased the house, he knew or should have known about the swampy condition of the environmentalist's property. | IX. that the standing water in his yard is not the source of the mosquito problem. | X. that the investor owns the property but has rented it out, so the investor does not have actual possession or the right to immediate possession of the land.

The worker used his own truck to travel between the company's warehouse and the construction sites, but the company fitted the truck with a rack for carrying plumbing pipes. The company paid the worker for traveling between the warehouse and the construction sites, but not for his drive to and from work. Because the worker was required to haul pipes on his truck while driving between the warehouse and the construction sites, the company asked the worker, before hiring him, whether he had a valid driver's license. The worker represented that he did, although in fact his license had been suspended because he had been convicted of recklessly causing motor vehicle collisions. The company made no effort to verify the worker's representation. While driving to work one morning in his truck, the worker carelessly caused a collision in which a woman was injured. In her subsequent action against the plumbing company, based on a theory of negligent hiring, is the woman likely to prevail? Choices: I.

The defendant said that he would represent himself at trial then, as \"anything [was] better than having this lawyer.\" The defendant did not raise the subject again, and he represented himself at trial. After hearing overwhelming evidence of the defendant's guilt, the jury convicted him of armed robbery. On appeal, the defendant has requested a new trial on the ground that he was deprived of his right to counsel. Should the appellate court grant the defendant's request? Choices: I. No, because the defendant made a conscious decision to represent himself after the judge's refusal. | II. No, because the defendant had the opportunity to request another lawyer but chose not to. | III.

The so-called installment land contract has been popular as a substitute for the mortgage or deed of trust. Under such a contract, the seller agrees to accept, and the buyer agrees to pay, the purchase price in installments over a stipulated period of time. The vendor retains legal title as security for the payment of the purchase price; and the vendee has equitable title under the doctrine of equitable conversion. The most important characteristic of the installment land contract, however, is the forfeiture clause, which provides that if the vendee is in default for 30 days, the vendor may, at his option, declare a forfeiture of the contract, in which case all payments made shall be forfeited as \"liquidated\" damages and the buyer shall become a tenant at will of the seller. Over the years, many sellers of property under such installment land contracts have declared forfeitures in situations where the prospective buyers were delinquent in their payments, even when the buyer was late with a single payment after nearly all the other payments had been made. In order to remedy this inequitable situation, the state legislature enacted a statute requiring any seller attempting to declare a forfeiture of an installment land contract to do so by instituting a formal foreclosure action in the courts. The new law also provided that prior to the commencement of such a foreclosure action, the seller under such an arrangement must give the buyer a 60-day grace period to make up any delinquent installment payment with interest. The new law expressly applied both to installment land contracts entered into subsequent to its enactment and to installment land contracts already in existence at the time of its enactment.

The tenant \u0080\u0094corporation lease was for a period of five years, with a rental of $15,000 per month, payable by the corporation to the tenant. In addition, the corporation agreed to abide \"by all of the terms and conditions of the lease between the landlord and the tenant. \"One year later, the corporation leased the premises to a health club for the balance of the term of the corporation \u0080\u0094tenant lease. The health club owner took possession of the said premises on February 1, the same day that the corporation vacated its occupancy. Pursuant to the corporation \u0080\u0094health club leasehold agreement, the latter was obligated to pay a monthly rental of $17,500 directly to the corporation. The health club has a \u0080\u0098B' credit rating with the well-known credit rating company. For one year, the health club paid $17,500, each month directly to the corporation. During that same period, the corporation continued to pay $15,000 each month to the tenant, while the latter paid $10,000 (each month) to the landlord.

In addition, if you put in a minimum of 10 hours per week during that time, I promise to hire you full-time as an associate when you pass the bar exam. \" The attorney then reduced this agreement to writing, which both he and the law student signed. The law student continued to work for the lawyer throughout the rest of his law school career and while he was studying for the bar exam. During that time, the law student always worked a minimum of 10 hours per week. While the law student was awaiting the results of the bar exam, his uncle passed away and left him a large apartment building. The law student decided he did not want to practice law but wanted to spend all of his time managing the apartment building.

The father then told the finance manager of the car lot, \"If you will sell the car to my son and for any reason he defaults on the payments, I will pay the balance due. \" The finance manager then approved the deal, which required the son to pay $2,500 down and monthly payments of $500 for 15 months.

The fan told the friend that the game started at 7:00 p. m. and that he would pick him up at about 5:00 p. m. so they could get there early to watch batting practice.

He raised $1 million from various sources to fund the project. After searching for a vacant lot that would be sufficient for development, the developer concluded that there was not a suitable vacant lot available. Reluctantly, the developer concluded that he would have to purchase a developed lot, have the existing structures removed, and then build the apartment house. The developer was reluctant to do this, because he had not budgeted for the additional cost of buying a developed property and removing the development. After a search for an appropriate parcel, the developer purchased a large lot, developed with a single-story residential home, for $200,000. He then spent $50,000 having the residential home removed from the lot. Knowing that it would cost approximately $850,000 to build the apartment house, the developer realized he would need to raise another $100,000. He approached an investor about lending him $100,000.

Shortly thereafter, the other co-defendant phoned the casino and made a demand for the money. He said a bomb was in the casino and that it would explode in 24 hours unless the money was paid.

No, because the man started the flurry of shots instead of surrendering; he caused the woman's death and is guilty of first degree murder. | II. Yes, because the police officer who shot the woman should be the one charged with murder, not the man. | III. Yes, because the majority view is that felony murder does not apply if a co-conspirator is killed by a third person during the commission of the crime. | IV. No, because the man was part of the crime and his actions led directly to the woman's death. | V. Yes, because the woman was a co-conspirator, not a victim of the crime, and therefore her death does not qualify as a felony murder. | VI. Yes, because the felony murder rule only applies when the defendant is the one who directly causes the death. | VII. Yes, because the felony murder rule has been declared unconstitutional. | VIII. No, because all states recognize that felony murder applies to any deaths that occur during the commission of the crime regardless of who fired the fatal shot. | IX. No, because felony murder applies regardless of who fires the fatal shot as long as a death occurred during the commission of the felony. | X. No, because the man's decision to raise his gun at the officers instigated the shooting, making him responsible for the woman's death. Answer:\n", "Result": "\nThe correct answer is III. Yes, because the majority view is that felony murder does not apply if a co-conspirator is killed by a third person during the commission of the crime.\n\nExplanation:\n\nFelony murder is a legal doctrine that holds a defendant guilty of murder if a death occurs during the commission of a felony, regardless of whether the defendant intended to kill anyone. However, there is a split in the jurisdictions as to whether felony murder applies when a co-conspirator is killed by a third person during the commission of the crime.\n\nThe majority view is that felony murder does not apply in such cases, as the defendant did not directly cause the death. This is because the felony murder rule is based on the idea that the defendant's actions caused the death, and if a third person causes the death, the defendant's actions did not directly cause it.\n\nThere", "MaxTokenProbability": "I", "Perplexity": 5.03, "GroundTruth": "III.

Although it is not the only lake in the county, it is the largest and most scenic, and it attracts visitors from miles around. One of its biggest assets is the excellent fishing and boating, which is available to the public at large. Three years ago, in order to enhance the recreational aspects of the lake, the county leased a sizable portion of the lake and surrounding parkland to a company owned by the most prominent family in the county. The lease required the company to construct and operate a first-rate yacht house and club, complete with bar, restaurant, and private marina, and to pay the county 10% of its net profits as rent. The company set up bylaws, which were reviewed and approved by the county at the time the lease was negotiated. According to the bylaws, the yacht club, complete with its restaurant and bar, would be open to members only, and the membership committee was empowered to set up strict membership \"standards,\" as well as the cost of membership fees and dues. Upon completion of the facilities, the state granted the company a license to sell alcoholic beverages in its restaurant and bar. The membership committee announced that the membership fee was $5,000 and the monthly dues $75. Furthermore, the membership committee had a policy of approving only membership applications from men, while disapproving and denying all applications from women. There were other similar facilities within the county available to women.

In preparing for the bar examination, the graduate planned to take a bar review course. Although she had not pre-enrolled, the graduate planned to attend and pay for the course at registration.

By the time the graduate got to the course location, registration had already been completed. When the graduate looked into the room where the course was being conducted, she saw the lecture had begun, and everyone was inside busily taking notes.

Although the graduate intended to pay the enrollment fee, no one was at the registration table to take her money. After attending the first couple of classes, the graduate sent a cashier's check for the full amount of the enrollment fee to the bar review company. Unbeknownst to the graduate, the bar review course's regional director noticed that she had entered the lectures without paying.

In the letter, the dean offered to employ the applicant for the upcoming academic year, which started on August 15, at a salary of $75,000. The letter also listed the employment terms and conditions, one of which stated that professors are entitled to five paid sick days during the year. The dean included a detailed employment contract containing all these terms, for the applicant's signature. After the applicant received this letter, he replied by mail, requesting a salary of $85,000 and sick leave of 10 days. Upon receipt of the applicant's letter, the dean telephoned the applicant and told him that the law school followed the American Bar Association guidelines with respect to salary and sick leave for its professors. The applicant acquiesced on the salary question, but insisted that his sick leave be extended to 10 days. The dean replied, \"Let's not permit a minor issue to stand in the way of your coming to teach at our law school.

The president of a development company is interested in purchasing three of the four parcels. The president buys the three parcels from the farmer and begins formulating plans for constructing single-family dwelling units on the land. The original deed between the farmer and the development company contains a provision expressly binding \"upon all subsequent grantees, their heirs, and assigns,\" stipulating that any further subdivisions by any such persons shall be restricted to minimum two-acre lots to be used for single- family dwelling units only. The development company immediately subdivided two of the parcels into lots of three, four, and five acres, and began construction of homes thereon. The original deed restrictions were enumerated within the special warranty deeds and were given to the purchasers of the homes in the new development, called phase 1. Two years later, the president sold the remaining parcel, which had not been included in the phase 1 subdivision plan, to a contractor. The contractor, in turn, drafted a subdivision plan for the last 250-acre parcel, dividing it into one-acre lots.

However, the distributor refused to fill the retailer's next order, claiming that the retailer had overcharged customers to install the distributor's windows.

While the woman was away on a vacation, there was a burglary at her home, and her favorite painting was stolen. Although the painting was insured for $1,000,000 by an insurance company, it had a market value of over $1,500,000. When the woman returned from vacation, she met with a detective employed by the insurance company to investigate the theft. During their meeting, the woman told the detective that she would pay him an extra $50,000 if he recovered the paihting. For the next three weeks, the detective investigated the theft as part of his job responsibilities with the insurance company. Within the course of this investigation, the detective learned who was responsible for the burglary. As a consequence, the culprit was apprehended, and the painting was recovered and returned to the woman. The detective then requested the $50,000 that the woman had promised to pay him. After the woman refused to make the payment, the detective sued the woman for breach of contract. Who is most likely to prevail? Choices: I. The woman, because her promise was gratuitous. | II. The woman, because the detective was already paid by the insurance company for his investigative services. | III. The detective, because he did the act necessary to constitute an acceptance of the woman's offer. | IV.

While in prison, federal authorities began investigating the murder of the defendant's 11-year- old stepdaughter who was murdered two years earlier. Believing that the defendant was responsible for this killing, federal agents decided to plant an informant at the prison to befriend the defendant and possibly obtain evidence about the crime. In accord with this plan, the federal agents hired a paid informant and placed him in the prison as a fellow inmate, masquerading as an organized crime figure. The informant soon befriended the defendant and learned that he was being threatened by other inmates because of a rumor that he had killed a child. The informant then raised the subject in several conversations, but the defendant repeatedly denied any such involvement. After the defendant started receiving tough treatment from other inmates because of the rumor, the informant offered to protect the defendant but told him, \"You have to tell me the truth about what really happened you know, if you want me to help you. \" Believing that the informant would protect him from the other inmates, the defendant then admitted to the informant that he had driven his stepdaughter to the desert where he killed her.

The rental agreement provided that the land was to be used as farmland. Shortly after the tenant took possession of the tract of land, he built thereon, at his own expense, a barn made of lumber, which was 15 feet wide, 20 feet long, and set on loose bricks. The barn increased the appraised market value of the tract of land from $250,000 to $275,000. The tenant then began farming operations on the land. Toward the end of the lease period, the owner informed the tenant that he was going to put the tract of land up for sale. The next month, when the lease expired, the parties settled a dispute over the tenant's right, if any, to compensation for the improvements by the following written agreement:\"On the sale of the tract of land, the owner hereby agrees to pay the tenant two-thirds of any sale proceeds in excess of $250,000, provided that tenant may remain on the farm for the next year, rent-free, while the owner tries to sell it.

The woman's sister owns parcel \"C,\" which lies the lowest on the mountain. Parcel \"B\" lies between Parcels \"A\" andIn 2000, the woman who originally owned all three parcels of land constructed a private drainage system. This system consisted of an underground pipeline that extended across all three parcels of land. Sewage from parcel \"A\" drained through the system to a municipal sewer, which was located at the bottom of the mountain. In 2005, the sister purchased parcel \"C\" from the woman. The deed to the sister did not contain any mention of the woman's drainage system. Located on each of the parcels are large ranch-style homes occupied by the respective owners. A portion of the sister's unimproved land began to subside over the drainage system.

Although the state provides both sexes with equal pay and benefits, the state has adopted a policy that prohibits the assignment of female officers to its special undercover narcotics division. This is a moderate risk position that sometimes involves violent encounters with drug dealers. Since the special narcotics division was first established, five undercover agents have been killed in the line of duty. It is because of the state's concern with the safety and well-being of its female officers that it has adopted such a policy. The woman, who desired to be a member of the narcotics division, filed an application for assignment as a special drug agent. After she was rejected for the position, the woman sued the state in federal court to enjoin enforcement of its stated policy on the grounds that it is unconstitutional. As a matter of constitutional law, which of the following results in this suit is most appropriate? Choices: I. Judgment for the woman, because the terms and conditions of state government employment are privileges or immunities of state citizenship that may not be abridged by the state on the basis of gender. | II. Judgment for the woman, because the facts asserted do not demonstrate that the particular classification contained in this policy is substantially related to the advancement of an important state interest. | III. Judgment for the state, because it is within a state's police power to insulate the terms and conditions of governmental employment. | IV. Judgment for the woman, because the state's policy is not narrowly tailored to serve a compelling state interest. | V. Judgment for the state, because the nature of the position justifies a gender-based classification. | VI. Judgment for the woman, because the state's policy constitutes unjustified sex discrimination. | VII. Judgment for the state, because the dangerous nature of the work in the narcotics division provides a valid basis for the policy. | VIII. Judgment for the state, because the state has articulated a rational basis for this classification and, therefore, a court may not substitute its judgment for that of responsible state officials. | IX. Judgment for the woman, because gender-based discrimination in state employment violates the Equal Protection Clause. | X. Judgment for the state, because the state has a compelling interest in protecting the safety of its employees.

At trial, the prosecution attempted to present the testimony of the victim's out-of-state sister regarding a telephone conversation she had with the defendant. She had called their landline number to talk with her sister on the same day when he had first reported to the police that his fianc\u00c3\u00a9 had been missing for five days. The sister had not met the man but had spoken with him briefly a few other times. He told her that her sister \"went out all night last night and did not return yet.\" The prosecution attempted at trial to have the sister testify to the conversation to show the significant discrepancy between his stories to the police and to her. The defense objected, arguing that she couldn't authenticate the conversation because she couldn't identify the speaker as the defendant nor had she ever met him. The prosecution told the court that she felt it was \"probably\" his voice, which she recollected from the prior talks at the same number. Will the court likely grant the defendant's objection to the testimony? Choices: I. Yes, because the sister cannot provide a reliable account due to her emotional state. | II.

The nephew and the agent entered into a valid written contract whereby the agent promised to undertake best efforts to find a buyer for the parcel. The contract also provided that the agent was to be paid a commission of 5 percent on the gross sale price following the consummation of the sale and transfer of title. The agent succeeded in finding a buyer for the parcel. The agent notified the nephew that he had found a developer who wanted to purchase the parcel for $500,000.

In order to facilitate the access to the cottage, the chef entered into an agreement with a neighbor, an adjoining land owner, whereby the neighbor, in writing, granted the chef a right-of-way over a strip of land 30 feet in width and a quarter of a mile in length along the eastern margin of the neighbor's property. Without notifying the neighbor, the chef proceeded to improve the roadbed by having the road asphalted in order to make it more accessible for motor vehicle traffic. Several years later, the neighbor started a sand business, which required him to do heavy hauling that subsequently destroyed the asphalted surface on the road. Ten years after the neighbor started his sand business, the chef sold his lakefront property to his assistant.

In federal court, a negligence suit was brought against the pilot by the father of the boy for his son. Accompanied by his father, the boy had visited an attorney for preliminary discussions regarding the case. However, the father did not retain the attorney to represent his son in the lawsuit. Instead, the father hired another lawyer to handle the case. At trial, the pilot's attorney calls the consulting attorney to testify what the boy had said to him regarding his physical condition during the consultation that the attorney had had with the boy and his father. The attorney's testimony is Choices: I. admissible, because the boy was not the attorney's client, only the father was. | II. inadmissible, because it was a statement of physical condition not made for the purpose of obtaining medical treatment. | III. admissible, because the lawsuit makes all previous communications related to the case public. | IV. inadmissible, because the attorney-client privilege is maintained even if a different attorney is hired. | V. admissible, because the father did not retain the consulting attorney, thus nullifying any privilege. | VI. inadmissible, because the boy is a minor and cannot legally waive his rights to attorney-client privilege. | VII. inadmissible, because the attorney-client privilege prevents such a breach of confidential communications. | VIII. admissible, because there is no privilege of confidentiality when a person other than the client is present at the attorney-client consultation. | IX. inadmissible, because the consultation was preliminary and does not constitute a formal attorney-client relationship. | X. admissible, because the attorney-client privilege was waived by the filing of the lawsuit.

During their stay at Yellowstone, the family camped out in a secluded area of the campgrounds surrounded by tall pine trees. Numerous signs had been posted throughout the campgrounds warning campers of the extremely dry conditions prevailing in the forest area due to a summerlong drought. On the morning of their departure, the family cooked breakfast over an open campfire. After breakfast, the family began to pack their gear into the van when the father instructed his 12-year-old son to put out the campfire. The son fetched two pails of water from a nearby pond and tossed the water over the campfire. Believing that he had extinguished the fire, the son joined his family in the van, and they drove away. Unbeknownst to the son and his family, the campfire was still smoldering when they left. Shortly thereafter, a wind gust blew the flames from the fire to some nearby brush. Due to the extremely dry conditions, the brush quickly ignited, starting a raging forest fire. The forest rangers dispatched a firefighting team, which included two helicopters equipped to fight the fire. While these helicopters were fighting the blaze from above, the smoke \u0080\u00a2 surrounding one of the helicopters became so intense that the pilot lost all visibility. At the same time, an operator of a small private plane saw the blaze and recklessly descended into the smoke. In the pilot's attempt to veer out of the intense smoke, his helicopter collided with the operator's low- flying plane, causing the aircrafts to crash. Both the pilot and the operator were killed in the resulting explosion.

Located below the ranch is an estate that is owned by a millionaire. A stream is a non-navigable watercourse that originates at the top of the mountain and runs all the way down into a valley. Both the ranch and the estate are within the watershed of the stream. When the millionaire purchased the estate in 1956, he started taking water from the stream and used it to irrigate the southern half of his property, which he has used as a farm. Prior to 1956, the southern half of the estate had been cleared and placed in cultivation, while the northern half remained wooded and virtually unused. The millionaire continued this established pattern of use and has never stopped using the water in this way. In 1986, the rancher built a home on the ranch and started talcing water from the stream for domestic purposes. During that year there was heavy rainfall, and this caused the stream to run down the mountain at a high water level. However, in 1987, a drought caused the stream to flow at a very low level. Consequently, there was only enough water to irrigate the millionaire's farmland or, in the alternative, to supply all of the rancher's domestic water needs and one-quarter of the millionaire's irrigation requirements. The mountain is located in a jurisdiction where the period of prescription is 15 years. The rancher is continuing to take water for his personal needs and there is insufficient water to irrigate the estate.

The son neglected to record the deed. In 1998, a farmer, aware of the existence of the rancher-to-son deed, sought out the rancher and asked to buy for $10,000 a deed to the orange grove from the rancher to the fanner and his heirs. The rancher executed such a deed, and the fanner promptly recorded it. The farmer's intent was to acquire color of title and obtain ownership of the orange grove by adverse possession. In 1998, the farmer constructed a fence around the orange grove. In 1999, the son presented his deed of the orange grove to a retiree, and for $15,000, paid by the retiree, signed and delivered a deed of the orange grove in favor of the retiree and his heirs. After receiving the deed, the retiree made no effort to search the title, to examine the property, or to record the deed.

His will devised his estate in a southern state to his uncle and his best friend \"to share and share alike as tenants in common. \"At the time of the homeowner's death, the uncle lived in a different part of the southern state (in which the estate was located), while the best friend resided in a northern state. After the homeowner's funeral, the uncle returned to his own residence, but the best friend decided to occupy the estate. He put his name on the mailbox and has paid the taxes and maintenance expenses. To earn extra money, the best friend rented a small house on the property to a teacher and received a monthly rental payment from her. The best friend also grew fruits on the property and sold them at a stand on Fridays. The uncle has been generally aware of this, but because he cared little about the estate, the uncle has never pressed the best friend about the property. Since 1985 the uncle has not paid any rent or other compensation to the best friend, nor has the best friend requested such payment. In January 2010, a series of disputes arose between the uncle and the best friend for the first time concerning their respective rights to the estate. The state in which the property is located recognizes the usual common law types of cotenancies and follows majority rules on rents and profits. There is no applicable legislation on the subject. The uncle brings an appropriate action for a portion of the proceeds that the best friend received from his fruit stand and a portion of the rent that the teacher paid. If the best friend contests the apportionment of the monies he received, judgment should be for whom? Choices: I. The uncle is entitled to a share of the rent that the teacher paid and the profits from the best friend's crops. | II.

The uncle and best friend must evenly split all profits and rents, regardless of who has been maintaining the property. | VII. The uncle is entitled to a share of the profits from the best friend's crops, but not the rent paid by the teacher. | VIII. The best friend is entitled to all monies raised due to his investment in the property, regardless of the uncle's claim. | IX. The uncle is entitled to no share of any of the monies raised because the uncle's lack of contact with the best friend will be deemed a waiver. | X.
