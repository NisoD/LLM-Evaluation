Freedom of choice is an essential feature of capitalism.\n\nExplanation:\n\nIn capitalism, freedom of choice is considered an essential feature because it allows individuals to make their own decisions about how to allocate their resources. This is in contrast to other economic systems, such as socialism, where the government makes decisions about the allocation of resources.\n\nCapitalism is based on the idea of individualism, where individuals are free to pursue their own interests and make their own choices.

Answer:\n", "Result": "\n4. The equilibrium price and quantity will both rise.\n\nExplanation: When the demand for a product falls while the supply simultaneously increases, it means that the product is now less scarce and therefore less valuable to consumers. As a result, the equilibrium price will rise to clear the excess supply, while the equilibrium quantity will also rise as consumers buy more of the product at the higher price.", "MaxTokenProbability": "4", "Perplexity": 3.15, "GroundTruth": "8.
