Instead, they can make a partial payment and promise to pay the remaining amount at a later date, usually with interest. This system is based on trust and the belief that the borrower will repay the loan in the future. Credit can be obtained from banks, financial institutions, or other lending organizations.

Product differentiation defines monopolistic competition and gives each firm some control over price. Answer:\n", "Result": "\nProduct differentiation is important in monopolistic competition because it allows firms to differentiate their products from those of their competitors, which can lead to higher prices and profits. This is because consumers are willing to pay a premium for products that are perceived as unique or superior to those of their competitors. Additionally, product differentiation can also lead to increased market share for the differentiated firm, as consumers may be more likely to choose their product over similar products offered by competitors.
