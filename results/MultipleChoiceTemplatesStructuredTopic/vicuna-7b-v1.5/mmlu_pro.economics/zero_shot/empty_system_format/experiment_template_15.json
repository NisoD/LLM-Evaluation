Consumer preference for uniform products\n\nExplanation: A purely competitive market is characterized by many firms producing identical products, and consumers have a preference for uniform products. If a purely competitive market were to degenerate into a monopolistically competitive market, it would be due to consumer preference for uniform products. The lower prices of pure competitors would not be able to drive out the higher-priced monopolistic competitor because consumers would still prefer the uniform product offered by the monopolistic competitor.", "MaxTokenProbability": "a", "Perplexity": 12.21, "GroundTruth": "b.
