Increased supply\n\nExplanation: An increasing national debt can lead to an increased supply of U.S. dollars in the market, which can cause the value of the dollar to depreciate. This is because an increased supply of a currency leads to a decrease in its value, as there are more dollars available for buyers, and each dollar is now worth less. As a result, the market for U.S. dollars may decline, and the value of the dollar may depreciate with respect to other currencies.", "MaxTokenProbability": "I", "Perplexity": 4.31, "GroundTruth": "VI.
