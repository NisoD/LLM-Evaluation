Choices: a. Schemes are learned responses to new stimuli. Assimilation is ignoring new environment. Accommodation is early infant behaviors.; b. Schemes are complex behaviors learned in adulthood. Assimilation is learning completely new responses to stimuli. Accommodation is ignoring new stimuli.; c. Schemes are innate reflexes that cannot be changed. Assimilation is adapting new stimuli to fit into existing schemes. Accommodation is the rejection of new stimuli that don't fit into existing schemes.; d. Schemes are mental representations of the world. Assimilation is the process of integrating new information into existing schemes without changing the schemes. Accommodation is the adjustment of existing schemes to incorporate new information.; e. Schemes are the only form of infant learning. Assimilation is the process of ignoring differences between stimuli. Accommodation is the process of retaining old behaviors in the face of new challenges.; f. Schemes are unconscious behaviors. Assimilation is changing previous behaviors to fit new environment. Accommodation is learning previously known methods.; g. Schemes are fixed psychological structures that determine behavior. Assimilation is the modification of the environment to fit pre-existing schemes. Accommodation is the alteration of schemes to adhere to societal norms.; h.
