Over the year, she has become fluent in social English. After a few months in a monolingual English second grade, her teacher refers her for evaluation because she has great difficulty with the basal reader used in the class. Two English proficiency tests administered to the student show that she performs above the mean for monolingual English grade peers in speaking and listening but well below the mean in reading and writing. She also performs well above the mean for grade peers on reading tests in her native language. Based on this information alone, which of the following is the most accurate interpretation? Choices: I.  The discrepancy between the student's native language reading skills and English reading skills is related to the greater complexity of English. OR II. The discrepancy between the student's native language reading skills and English reading skills is due to the different teaching methodologies in her previous and current schools. OR III.
