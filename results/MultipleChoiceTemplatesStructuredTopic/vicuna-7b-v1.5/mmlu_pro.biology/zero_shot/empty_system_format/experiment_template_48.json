But high levels of progesterone exerts a negative feedback action on LH secretion, with a consequent decrease in LH secretion and eventual atrophy of the corpus luteum. Atrophy of the corpus luteum cuts the progesterone supply resulting in menstruation. Clearly, these events cannot take place after conception, or the embryo would get sloughed off. When conception occurs, the corpus luteum is seen to last through most of pregnancy. How can this be explained? Choices: I. The endometrium produces a hormone that supports the corpus luteum throughout pregnancy.; II. The body naturally adjusts progesterone levels during pregnancy.; III. The placenta secretes a hormone, chorionic gonadotrophin, which takes the place of LH in preserving the corpus luteum. This allows the corpus luteum to secrete high levels of progesterone without being shut off.; IV. The corpus luteum spontaneously increases in size during pregnancy, which maintains progesterone levels without hormonal regulation.; V. The corpus luteum is replaced by a secondary organ that secretes progesterone during pregnancy.; VI. The corpus luteum is not necessary during pregnancy.; VII. The embryo produces progesterone independently, eliminating the need for the corpus luteum after conception.; VIII.
