Choices: A. conjugation results in no genetic diversity\nB. conjugation requires more than two organisms\nC. all individuals are identical genetically, and conjugation could not occur\nD. repeated fission in paramecia results in sterile offspring that cannot conjugate\nE. the group of paramecia lacks the cellular structures necessary for conjugation\nF. conjugation is only possible in the presence of a specific chemical signal absent in this group\nG. conjugation is prevented by the environmental conditions in which the paramecia live\nH. conjugation can occur regardless of genetic similarities\nI. paramecia descended from a single individual are incapable of conjugation due to a mutation\nJ. conjugation only occurs at a specific time of year which has not yet arrived Answer:\n", "Result": "\nA. conjugation results in no genetic diversity\n\nExplanation: Conjugation is the process of transferring genetic material between individuals of the same species. In the case of paramecia, conjugation involves the exchange of genetic material between two individuals through a temporary union of their cells. This process results in genetic diversity, as the offspring inherit genetic material from both parents. Therefore, it is not expected that conjugation would occur among a group of parame", "MaxTokenProbability": "A", "Perplexity": 8.11, "GroundTruth": "C. all individuals are identical genetically, and conjugation could not occur"}, {"Index": 715, "Instance": "Topic: biology\nQuestion: [question] Choices: [choices] Answer: [answer]\nQuestion: Black-headed gulls remove broken eggshells from their nests immediately after the young have hatched. Explain the biological significance of this behavior. Choices: A. Removing eggshells helps regulate the temperature within the nest for the chicks' comfort.\nB. The gulls remove eggshells to keep their nests clean.\nC. Eggshell-removing behavior reduces the chances of a nest being robbed, thus enhancing the survival of offspring.\nD. Removing eggshells is a way to create space for the hatched chicks.\nE. The eggshells are removed as a source of calcium for the gulls' diet.\nF. Removing eggshells prevents the eggs from being eaten by predators.\nG. The behavior is a social signal to other gulls that hatching has successfully occurred.\nH.
