But high levels of progesterone exerts a negative feedback action on LH secretion, with a consequent decrease in LH secretion and eventual atrophy of the corpus luteum. Atrophy of the corpus luteum cuts the progesterone supply resulting in menstruation. Clearly, these events cannot take place after conception, or the embryo would get sloughed off.

The endometrium produces a hormone that supports the corpus luteum throughout pregnancy., 2. The body naturally adjusts progesterone levels during pregnancy., 3. The placenta secretes a hormone, chorionic gonadotrophin, which takes the place of LH in preserving the corpus luteum.

Choices: 1. conjugation results in no genetic diversity, 2. conjugation requires more than two organisms, 3. all individuals are identical genetically, and conjugation could not occur, 4. repeated fission in paramecia results in sterile offspring that cannot conjugate, 5. the group of paramecia lacks the cellular structures necessary for conjugation, 6. conjugation is only possible in the presence of a specific chemical signal absent in this group, 7. conjugation is prevented by the environmental conditions in which the paramecia live, 8. conjugation can occur regardless of genetic similarities, 9. paramecia descended from a single individual are incapable of conjugation due to a mutation, 10. conjugation only occurs at a specific time of year which has not yet arrived Answer:\n", "Result": "\n1. conjugation results in no genetic diversity\nExplanation: Conjugation is a type of sexual reproduction in which genetic material is exchanged between two individuals. It results in genetic diversity by introducing new genetic material into the offspring. Therefore, it is not expected that conjugation would occur among a group of paramecia that had descended from a single individual through repeated fission, as all individuals would be genetically identical.", "MaxTokenProbability": "4", "Perplexity": 6.8, "GroundTruth": "3. all individuals are identical genetically, and conjugation could not occur", "Score": 0.0}, {"Index": 715, "Instance": "Topic: biology\nQuestion: [question] Choices: [choices] Answer: [answer]\nQuestion: Black-headed gulls remove broken eggshells from their nests immediately after the young have hatched. Explain the biological significance of this behavior. Choices: 1. Removing eggshells helps regulate the temperature within the nest for the chicks' comfort., 2. The gulls remove eggshells to keep their nests clean., 3. Eggshell-removing behavior reduces the chances of a nest being robbed, thus enhancing the survival of offspring., 4. Removing eggshells is a way to create space for the hatched chicks., 5. The eggshells are removed as a source of calcium for the gulls' diet., 6. Removing eggshells prevents the eggs from being eaten by predators., 7. The behavior is a social signal to other gulls that hatching has successfully occurred., 8. Removing eggshells is a way for the gulls to prepare the nest for future clutches of eggs., 9. The gulls remove eggshells to reduce the scent that may attract predators. Answer:\n", "Result": "\n3.
