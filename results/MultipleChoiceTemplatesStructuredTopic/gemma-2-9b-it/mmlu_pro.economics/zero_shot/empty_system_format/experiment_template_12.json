Choices: A. The AFC slopes downward due to a decrease in demand for the product, while the AVC slopes upward from the start due to increasing variable costs. or B. The AFC slopes upward as quantity increases or C. The AFC slopes downward because it represents the spread of fixed costs over an increasing number of units, while the AVC initially decreases due to a fixed proportion of inputs and then increases as variable input prices rise. or D. The AVC turns upward due to an increase in fixed inputs or E. The AFC slopes downward as quantity increases because of increased efficiency in production, while the AVC initially decreases due to underutilization of variable inputs and then increases because of market forces. or F. The AFC slopes downward because as quantity increases, the average fixed cost per unit decreases. The AVC slopes down at first due to fuller utilization of the fixed inputs and the extension of specialization but then turns upward due to the law of diminishing returns. or G. The AFC remains constant throughout because it is independent of output, and the AVC slopes downward indefinitely as economies of scale are realized. or H.

Air is free because its marginal utility is zero, it is not a scarce good.**\n\n**Explanation:**\n\nThe marginal utility approach to economics explains how consumers value goods and services. Marginal utility is the additional satisfaction a consumer gets from consuming one more unit of a good or service.\n\n* **Scarcity and Value:**  Goods and services have value because they are scarce.  The less available something is, the more people are willing to pay for it.\n\n* **Air's Abundance:** Air is incredibly abundant.  We have a near-infinite supply.
