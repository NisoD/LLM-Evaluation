To protect themselves, lenders will demand higher interest rates.\n\n* **Borrowers face higher costs.**  Higher interest rates make borrowing more expensive, which can slow down economic activity.\n\n\nLet me know if you have any other economics questions!\n", "MaxTokenProbability": "h", "Perplexity": 17.11, "GroundTruth": "c.

No, every increase in national income does not necessarily result in an increase of employment.**\n\nHere's why:\n\n* **Productivity Growth:**  An increase in national income could be driven by productivity gains (producing more with the same amount of labor). This might lead to higher output but not necessarily more jobs.\n\n* **Automation:** Technological advancements can boost productivity and national income but also lead to job displacement as machines replace human labor.\n\n* **Structural Shifts:**  Changes in consumer demand or industry trends can cause shifts in employment even if overall national income is rising.\n\n* **Other Factors:**  ", "MaxTokenProbability": "i", "Perplexity": 7.46, "GroundTruth": "i.
