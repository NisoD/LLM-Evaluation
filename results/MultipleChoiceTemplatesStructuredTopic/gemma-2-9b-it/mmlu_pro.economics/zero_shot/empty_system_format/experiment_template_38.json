Answer:\n", "Result": "\n\nThe correct answer is **8. The equilibrium price and quantity will both fall.**\n\nHere's why:\n\n* **Demand and Supply:**  The equilibrium price and quantity are determined by the intersection of the demand and supply curves.\n\n* **Demand Falls:** When demand falls, the demand curve shifts to the left. This means consumers are willing to buy less at every price point.\n\n* **Supply Increases:** When supply increases, the supply curve shifts to the right. This means producers are willing to sell more at every price point.\n\n* **Combined Effect:** The combination of decreased demand and increased supply will put downward pressure on the price", "MaxTokenProbability": "8", "Perplexity": 4.07, "GroundTruth": "10.
