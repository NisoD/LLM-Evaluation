The tax is regressive because it is a flat tax that takes a smaller proportion of income as the income rises.**\n\n**Explanation:**\n\nA regressive tax is a tax that takes a larger percentage of income from lower-income earners than from higher-income earners. The federal payroll tax is a flat tax, meaning everyone pays the same percentage of their income up to a certain limit.  \n\n* **Why this is regressive:** As income increases, the percentage of income paid in taxes decreases.
