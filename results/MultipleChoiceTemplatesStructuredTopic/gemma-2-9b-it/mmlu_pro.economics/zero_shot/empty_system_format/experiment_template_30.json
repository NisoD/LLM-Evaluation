She should increase her apple consumption and decrease her orange consumption until the marginal utility per dollar is equal for both.\n3. She should spend all her money on apples since they are cheaper.\n4. She should save her lunch money instead of spending it on apples and oranges.\n5. She should continue consuming apples and oranges at the same rate, regardless of marginal utility.\n6. She should decrease her apple consumption and increase her orange consumption until the marginal utility per dollar is equal for both.\n7. She should increase her apple consumption and decrease her orange consumption until the marginal utility is equal for both.\n8. She should increase her apple consumption and decrease her orange consumption until the total utility is maximized, regardless of the price.\n9.
