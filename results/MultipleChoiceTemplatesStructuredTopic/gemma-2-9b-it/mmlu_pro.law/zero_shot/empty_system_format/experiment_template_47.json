The statute provides that such information must be written on the ballot in ink inan appropriate space. A write-in candidate is a German-American and is of the opinion that he needs a large turnout of German voters in order to win the election. As a result, his campaign manager decides to mail to every registered German voter a tear-off sticker, which bears the candidate's name and office for which he is running. Since many native German people are not proficient in reading and writing English, the campaign manager believes that many of the voters will have difficulty writing the candidate's name and office on the ballot. As a result, the campaign manager has mounted an extensive media campaign to inform voters on how to apply the stickers to the ballot. Five months prior to the election an election official notifies the candidate's campaign committee that the tear-off stickers do not comply with the state statute. In her letter, the official explains that state election officials are of the opinion that it is necessary for potential voters to write the candidate's name in ink. Therefore, she concludes that the stickers do not comply with statutory requirements. Three weeks later, the candidate filed suit in federal district court against state election officials, claiming that their interpretation of the state statute violates the U. S. Constitution. Which of the following sets forth the strongest constitutional argument the candidate could make against the interpretation of the statute by the state officials? Choices: I.

The widower lived in a farmhouse on the lemon grove and used the property to raise produce. Adjoining the lemon grove directly to the west was a 10-acre farm that was owned in fee simple by a farmer. There was a four-lane highway that adjoined the lemon grove directly to the east. The widower, by way of gift, executed a deed naming his daughter as grantee. The deed granted to the daughter and her heirs an antebellum mansion located near the southern edge of the lemon grove. The antebellum mansion was accessible by a little- used road that ran west to east from the farmlgrove border to the four-lane highway along the southern boundary of the grove. The daughter recorded her deed and took immediate possession of the property. A short while later, the daughter and the farmer fell in love and began seeing each other quite frequently. In order for the farmer to reach the daughter's house, it was necessary for him to travel over the little-used road across the lemon grove. Many years later, the farmer, who was still having an affair with the daughter, met her father at a Rotary Club meeting. They struck up a conversation, and the widower asked the farmer, \"Have you been driving your pickup along that little-used back road on my property?\" The farmer, who was afraid to tell the widower about his love affair with the daughter, responded with a half-truth, \"Yes, I've been using it as a shortcut to the four-lane highway. \" Unaware that the farmer was also using the path to get to the antebellum mansion to see the daughter, the widower said, \"No problem, I just wanted to be sure that it was you who was using the road. \"Thereafter, the widower found out about his daughter's relationship with the farmer.

The principal, sent the student's parents a letter notifying them of the three-day suspension for the above-mentioned charges. The suspension was to take effect on February 1. The principal also included a copy of the disciplinary code in the letter. On January 19, the student and his mother met with the principal in his office to discuss the matter, and the student admitted that he used abusive language to a fellow student. On January 22, the student's parents received a letter informing them that his teacher had upheld the school administration's decision to suspend their son. They were then notified of a hearing on the recommended suspension to be held at the school. The parents did not attend this hearing, but were advised that the school board upheld the suspension, effective February 1. Which of the following most accurately summarizes the applicable rule of constitutional law with respect to the student's suspension? Choices: I. The student's suspension violated his right to a fair trial., II. The student's suspension did not constitute a denial of due process., III. The school administration's decision was protected under the Tenth Amendment's guarantee of states' rights., IV. The student's suspension was a violation of the Eighth Amendment's prohibition of cruel and unusual punishment., V.

The first cousin put up his interest in the joint tenancy as security for a $20,000 loan and signed a judgment note. It was later entered as a judgment against the first cousin's interest in the real estate. The first cousin died a year later. The second cousin decided to sell the property, but the mortgagee filed an action to prevent the sale and to enforce his interest in the property. The second cousin defended on the basis that any lien on the first cousin's interest in the property was extinguished on the first cousin's death. Will the court enforce the lien of the mortgagee against the sale of the property by the surviving second cousin? Choices: I. No, because a joint tenant cannot legally file a judgment note on just that joint tenant's interest because it would be an unconstitutional interference with the other's property rights., II. No, because when the first cousin died the second cousin became the sole owner due to the right of survivorship, as per the joint tenancy which was still fully intact., III. No, because the second cousin did not have knowledge of the first cousin's debt before his death., IV. Yes, because the mortgagee has the right to enforce his interest in the property to recover the loan., V. Yes, because a mortgage or judgment lien against one joint tenant destroys the tenancy and destroys the right of survivorship., VI. Yes, because the second cousin's assent to the judgment lien was presumed by law and that assent destroyed the joint tenancy., VII. Yes, because the mortgagee has a valid claim to the property due to the first cousin's unpaid loan., VIII. No, because the first cousin's debt did not affect the second cousin's rights to the property., IX. Yes, because the first cousin's debt was not settled before his death, hence the property cannot be sold until the debt is settled. Answer:\n", "Result": "The correct answer is **V. Yes, because a mortgage or judgment lien against one joint tenant destroys the tenancy and destroys the right of survivorship.**\n\nHere's why:\n\n* **Joint Tenancy with Right of Survivorship:** This type of ownership means that when one joint tenant dies, their interest automatically passes to the surviving joint tenant(s). \n* **Lien Impact:** A lien against one joint tenant's interest severs the joint tenancy.  The lienholder can claim the property to satisfy the debt. The right of survivorship is extinguished because the lien creates a separate interest in the property.\n\n**Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:**\n\n* **I, II, III, VIII:** These options focus on the idea that the second cousin should be protected from the first cousin's debt.
