The statute provides that such information must be written on the ballot in ink inan appropriate space. A write-in candidate is a German-American and is of the opinion that he needs a large turnout of German voters in order to win the election. As a result, his campaign manager decides to mail to every registered German voter a tear-off sticker, which bears the candidate's name and office for which he is running. Since many native German people are not proficient in reading and writing English, the campaign manager believes that many of the voters will have difficulty writing the candidate's name and office on the ballot. As a result, the campaign manager has mounted an extensive media campaign to inform voters on how to apply the stickers to the ballot. Five months prior to the election an election official notifies the candidate's campaign committee that the tear-off stickers do not comply with the state statute. In her letter, the official explains that state election officials are of the opinion that it is necessary for potential voters to write the candidate's name in ink. Therefore, she concludes that the stickers do not comply with statutory requirements. Three weeks later, the candidate filed suit in federal district court against state election officials, claiming that their interpretation of the state statute violates the U. S. Constitution. Which of the following sets forth the strongest constitutional argument the candidate could make against the interpretation of the statute by the state officials? Choices: I. It unreasonably restricts freedom of speech as guaranteed by the First Amendment. II. It unreasonably interferes with the 1965 Voting Rights Act outlawing literacy tests. III.

The widower lived in a farmhouse on the lemon grove and used the property to raise produce. Adjoining the lemon grove directly to the west was a 10-acre farm that was owned in fee simple by a farmer. There was a four-lane highway that adjoined the lemon grove directly to the east. The widower, by way of gift, executed a deed naming his daughter as grantee. The deed granted to the daughter and her heirs an antebellum mansion located near the southern edge of the lemon grove. The antebellum mansion was accessible by a little- used road that ran west to east from the farmlgrove border to the four-lane highway along the southern boundary of the grove. The daughter recorded her deed and took immediate possession of the property. A short while later, the daughter and the farmer fell in love and began seeing each other quite frequently. In order for the farmer to reach the daughter's house, it was necessary for him to travel over the little-used road across the lemon grove. Many years later, the farmer, who was still having an affair with the daughter, met her father at a Rotary Club meeting. They struck up a conversation, and the widower asked the farmer, \"Have you been driving your pickup along that little-used back road on my property?\" The farmer, who was afraid to tell the widower about his love affair with the daughter, responded with a half-truth, \"Yes, I've been using it as a shortcut to the four-lane highway. \" Unaware that the farmer was also using the path to get to the antebellum mansion to see the daughter, the widower said, \"No problem, I just wanted to be sure that it was you who was using the road. \"Thereafter, the widower found out about his daughter's relationship with the farmer.

The first cousin put up his interest in the joint tenancy as security for a $20,000 loan and signed a judgment note. It was later entered as a judgment against the first cousin's interest in the real estate. The first cousin died a year later. The second cousin decided to sell the property, but the mortgagee filed an action to prevent the sale and to enforce his interest in the property. The second cousin defended on the basis that any lien on the first cousin's interest in the property was extinguished on the first cousin's death. Will the court enforce the lien of the mortgagee against the sale of the property by the surviving second cousin? Choices: I. No, because a joint tenant cannot legally file a judgment note on just that joint tenant's interest because it would be an unconstitutional interference with the other's property rights. II. No, because when the first cousin died the second cousin became the sole owner due to the right of survivorship, as per the joint tenancy which was still fully intact. III. No, because the second cousin did not have knowledge of the first cousin's debt before his death. IV. Yes, because the mortgagee has the right to enforce his interest in the property to recover the loan. V.

The owner entered into a valid written brokerage agreement with a real estate broker. According to terms of the agreement, the broker promised to undertake best efforts to sell the estate for a purchase price of not less than $1,250,000. The contract also provided that the broker was to be paid a commission of 5 percent on the gross sale price following the consummation of the sale and transfer of title. The brokerage agreement was effective for a period of two months. One month later, the broker notified the owner that she had found a buyer who wanted to purchase the property for $1,500,000. That same day, the broker handed the owner a real estate sales contract, signed by the buyer, in which the buyer agreed to pay $1,500,000 for the purchase of the estate. The owner investigated the buyer and discovered he had sufficient funds to purchase the estate. However, the owner changed his mind and decided not to sell the property. He told the broker that he would not sign the agreement. In addition, the owner told the broker that he was canceling their brokerage agreement because he was withdrawing the estate from the market. The owner also refused to pay the broker any commission. If the broker now sues the owner for breach of contract, which of the following, if anything, is the broker's proper measure of recovery?

The man with the box reached the edge of the platform, next to the train, just as the train started to move. The man hesitated, unsure of whether he should give up or go ahead and jump onto the train even though it was moving. A railroad worker, who happened to be standing next to the train, decided to be helpful. He said, \"You can make it,\" and gave the man a shove toward the open door of the train. The man stumbled and dropped the box that he was carrying. Instantly, the box made a loud screeching noise. The box contained powerful fireworks, and the impact of the box hitting the ground had caused a large rocket to ignite. The rocket flew out of the box and shot across the train station, glancing off the ceiling and finally crashing into a wall of a small coffee shop on the far side of the train station, about 150 feet from the train.

This black-colored mineral consists of massive uraninite and contains radium, which is the chief ore-mineral source of uranium. Minute quantities of plutonium are also found in pitchblende. This is particularly significant because plutonium undergoes slow disintegration with the emission of a helium nucleus to form uranium 235, and that is fissionable with slow neutrons to yield atomic energy. As such, pitchblende is vital to the economy of the entire country. Congress has recently enacted a statute forbidding any state from imposing a tax on the extraction of pitchblende.

In 1994, the farmer delivered to his son, for a sum of $1,000, a deed signed by the farmer, naming the son and his heirs as grantee, and appearing valid on its face. The son neglected to record the deed. In 1998, an investor, aware of the existence of the farmer-to-son deed, sought out the farmer and asked to buy for $10,000 a deed of the farm from the farmer to the investor and his heirs. The farmer executed such a deed, and the investor promptly recorded it. The investor's intent was to acquire color of title and obtain ownership of the farm by adverse possession. In 1998, the investor constructed a fence around the farm. In 1999, the son presented his deed of the farm to a rancher and, for $15,000, paid by the rancher, signed and delivered a deed of the farm in favor of the rancher and his heirs. After receiving the deed, the rancher made no effort to search the title, to examine the property, or to record the deed. In 2003, a teacher paid the investor $20,000, and the investor delivered to the teacher a deed of the farm in favor of the teacher and his heirs. The teacher had examined the property, had searched the title, and was aware of the prior farmer-to-son instrument. Although the teacher did not reside on the property,he regularly visited the farm twice a week. The teacher recorded his deed. In 2007, for $25,000, paid by a professor, the rancher signed and delivered a deed of the farm naming the professor and his heirs as grantees.

The suspect had attention deficit disorder, dyslexia and an IQ of 72. Prior to beginning they read a list of Miranda rights to him on a form that the suspect had in front of him. After the reading, he initialed each paragraph indicating he understood. At the bottom of the form was an express written waiver of the Miranda rights, which he signed. He had been interrogated in the past and was familiar with the procedure. During the four hours of interrogation he was given bathroom breaks, coffee, and a sandwich. At the end of the process, he made a logical and seemingly cogent confession to all of the burglaries in a taped statement.

What is the most likely decision of the court under the totality of the circumstances? Choices: I. The suspect's past familiarity with the procedure proves he understood the situation and his confession is valid. II.

The police initially gave him a written list of his Miranda rights. They told him to read the list out loud, which he did. They then asked him if he understood the right to remain silent and to have a lawyer present and he nodded affirmatively. He refused to sign the writing but did not ask for an attorney. During the next three hours they interrogated him and got few answers; he was largely silent but did respond at times with a \"no\" or \"yes\" or a nod of the head.

A National Trade Council sued the state in federal court seeking an injunction and declaratory judgment that the state law toward Cuba was unconstitutional. 30 of the business entities that were discriminated against by the state were members of the council. Is the federal court likely to grant the declaratory judgment and declare the state law unconstitutional? Choices: I.

After a subsequent legislative hearing, the communist is dismissed from his position by the union. Which of the following most accurately summarizes the applicable rule of constitutional law regarding the aforementioned provision of the statute? Choices: I. The statute is valid as it is a reasonable restriction on the First Amendment rights of an individual in the interest of national security. II. The statutory provision is a violation of the person's Eighth Amendment right against cruel and unusual punishment. III. Making it a crime for a Communist to hold a union office is a suspect classification, which violates the equal protection clause. IV. The statutory provision is a form of unconstitutional prior restraint on a person's First Amendment right of free association. V.

The tipster also said that one of the men had red hair and was wearing a tan ball cap and the other man had black hair and was wearing a red ball cap. The police set up surveillance on the back of the restaurant and saw the two men make several hand- to-hand transactions. Upon receiving authority to make the arrest from their commanding officer, they waited for the two men to come out again. About two hours later, the two men came out again, this time with a woman. The officers arrested the two men and detained the woman to determine her involvement. The officers took the woman's purse without her consent and searched it for illegal narcotics. In her purse they found three grams of crack cocaine, digital scales, a small glass pipe used for inhaling crack cocaine, and a balloon of black tar heroin.

After being advised of his Miranda rights, the defendant requested permission to call his attorney. Although his attorney was unavailable, the attorney's receptionist admonished him not to say anything. The defendant told the detectives he would have nothing further to say unless his attorney was present. The detectives then asked him if he would accompany them to the police station to answer some questions about an unrelated robbery. The defendant agreed. As they were driving to the police station, the defendant was asked where he had purchased the boots that he was wearing. He refused to answer.

Before the swearing-in ceremony, however, the graduate received a letter from the bar examiners indicating that his admission would be delayed until a character fitness investigation had been completed. The examiners also requested information as to whether the graduate had ever been arrested, convicted, or placed on probation for a criminal offense. The graduate had been arrested as a juvenile for possession of marijuana. He was placed in a special drug education program for first- time juvenile offenders and was told that the arrest would be expunged. Since the graduate believed that he had been totally exonerated of criminal liability, he didn't report the arrest on his bar application form. The bar examiners had, in fact, received an anonymous letter making reference to the graduate's juvenile arrest and suggesting that he was not morally fit to be admitted as an attorney. In addition, the letter provided detailed information about the facts related to the offense. As a result, the examiners hired a special investigator, to look into the matter. As part of the investigator's inquiry, he went to the clerk of the juvenile court where the offense occurred and demanded access to the records concerning the graduate. The clerk refused, citing a state statute that required all court and police records relating to juveniles be sealed. After all other attempts to gain access to the records proved futile, the bar examiners filed suit in federal district court demanding access to the relevant documents. The court should rule that, as applied to this case, the state statute regarding the sealing of juvenile records is Choices: I. constitutional, because it safeguards the principle of rehabilitation by shielding individuals from their past juvenile offenses.

The so-called installment land contract has been popular as a substitute for the mortgage or deed of trust. Under such a contract, the seller agrees to accept, and the buyer agrees to pay, the purchase price in installments over a stipulated period of time. The vendor retains legal title as security for the payment of the purchase price; and the vendee has equitable title under the doctrine of equitable conversion. The most important characteristic of the installment land contract, however, is the forfeiture clause, which provides that if the vendee is in default for 30 days, the vendor may, at his option, declare a forfeiture of the contract, in which case all payments made shall be forfeited as \"liquidated\" damages and the buyer shall become a tenant at will of the seller. Over the years, many sellers of property under such installment land contracts have declared forfeitures in situations where the prospective buyers were delinquent in their payments, even when the buyer was late with a single payment after nearly all the other payments had been made. In order to remedy this inequitable situation, the state legislature enacted a statute requiring any seller attempting to declare a forfeiture of an installment land contract to do so by instituting a formal foreclosure action in the courts. The new law also provided that prior to the commencement of such a foreclosure action, the seller under such an arrangement must give the buyer a 60-day grace period to make up any delinquent installment payment with interest.

No, because application of the law to installment land contracts entered into before or after its enactment is a deprivation of a proprietary interest without due process of the law. III. No, because it changes the terms of contracts that have already been agreed upon and are in effect. IV. Yes, because it is a reasonable regulation of the procedure to be followed in such cases and does not substantially diminish the underlying obligations of the buyer. V. No, because it infringes on the seller's right to manage their property as they see fit. VI. Yes, because the authority to enact laws regulating real estate sales transactions occurring within the boundaries of individual states is reserved exclusively to the states by the Tenth Amendment. VII. Yes, because it balances the rights of both buyers and sellers in real estate transactions. VIII. No, because it interferes with the agreed contractual terms between the buyer and seller. IX.

The statute in question aims to prevent unfair forfeitures in installment land contracts, which can disproportionately harm buyers who may be struggling financially. This falls under the state's police power.\n\n* **Contract Modification:** While the statute does modify existing contracts, it does so in a way that is generally considered permissible. Courts often allow states to modify contracts to address public policy concerns, especially when the modification is reasonable and doesn't fundamentally change the nature of the agreement.\n\n* **Due Process:** The statute provides due process by requiring a formal foreclosure action and a 60-day grace period. This gives the buyer an opportunity to be heard and to cure the default before losing their property.\n\n**Why other", "MaxTokenProbability": "I", "Perplexity": 7.79, "GroundTruth": "IV.

The contract signed by the woman was to last for one year and called upon the woman to pay $2,000 in quarterly payments of $500. The contract also specified that all fees were non-refundable. Upon signing the contract, the woman made her first payment of $500 and started classes the next day. The woman attended classes on a regular basis for the next three months. At the end of the three-month period, the woman was involved in an automobile accident. Although she was not seriously injured, her doctor advised the woman that she needed complete rest. Her doctor told her to avoid strenuous activity and advised her to discontinue her pre-natal exercise classes. One week later, the woman received a billing notice from the gymnasium, indicating that her second installment payment of $500 was past due. She immediately telephoned the manager of the gymnasium and informed him that she would not be attending any further classes because of her accident. Also, the woman said she did not feel obligated to make any additional payments. Which of the following most accurately describes the woman's duty to pay the gymnasium the second installment fee of $500? Choices: I.

The knife severed an artery, causing the father to lose a lot of blood. The mother telephoned their family doctor, who instructed her to drive the father to the local hospital. The doctor indicated that he would meet them there. A short time later at the hospital, the doctor treated the father and bandaged his hand. However, due to the fact that the father had lost a considerable amount of blood, the doctor ordered an immediate blood transfusion. After determining that the father's blood type was A-positive, the doctor orally instructed a nurse, who was employed by the hospital, to obtain the necessary blood for the transfusion. The nurse followed the doctor's instructions and telephoned the hospital's blood bank department and ordered a unit of A-positive blood. The person in the blood bank who received the nurse's call correctly wrote down the order for A-positive blood. However, someone working at the blood bank, whose identity cannot be determined, made an error in filling the order and labeling the unit of blood for the father. As a result, the blood bank sent a unit of B-positive blood mislabeled as A-positive blood. After being administered the wrong blood, the father died. The hospital has a written rule in effect whereby all orders for blood transfusions must be made in writing by the physician in charge of the patient's treatment.

Under the law, applicants for certification must attend a monthlong course, pass a test, and pay a fee of $1,000. The stated purpose of the law is to \"promote uniformity in the methods of ski instruction at the state's ski areas.\" Shortly before the law's enactment, when the state did not require certification of ski instructors, a woman moved to the state intending to find employment as a ski instructor. The woman had been a ski instructor in another state for many years. But since her move, even though ski resorts in the state have found her to be highly qualified, no resort will offer her a contract for employment as a ski instructor because she has not received the required state certification.

The performances of the homeowner and the roofer would be constructive concurrent conditions.**\n\n* **Concurrent Conditions:**  In a contract, concurrent conditions mean that both parties are obligated to perform their promises at the same time.  \n\n* **Constructive Concurrent Conditions:**  When the contract doesn't explicitly state that performance is to happen simultaneously, the law often implies that it is. This is called a constructive concurrent condition.\n\n**Let's analyze the other options:**\n\n* **I. & III.:** These are incorrect because they suggest one party's performance is a *condition precedent* to the other's. A condition precedent means one party must fulfill their obligation *before* the other is obligated to perform.\n\n* **II., VI.:** These are incorrect because while it's generally advisable to have contracts in writing, oral contracts *can* be enforceable.

After they read him his constitutional rights, he insisted that he was acting voluntarily. He then took them to the scene of the murder where they found the victim's body.

The landlord leases the land and building thereon to a tenant for a term of seven years, commencing on August 1, 2001, and terminating at midnight on July 31, 2008. The lease contains the following provisions\"(1) The tenant covenants to keep the building on the leased premises insured against fire in the amount of $100,000. \"After three years of the lease had expired, the tenant assigned the entire balance of the lease period to a doctor, who took immediate possession of the leased property. Then in 2005, the doctor assigned his leasehold interest to a dentist. The dentist went into possession, but failed to pay any rent for two months. Soon afterwards, a fire spread from an adjoining building to the leased property, completely destroying the building thereon. While the tenant was in possession of the leased property, he carried a fire insurance policy on the premises in the amount of $100,000. However, the tenant allowed the policy to lapse after his assignment to the doctor. The doctor did carry insurance on the leased building, but only in the amount of $50,000. When the dentist took possession of the building, he did not obtain any fire insurance. The landlord learned that the building was not insured at the time of the fire as per the original agreement. In an action by the landlord against the tenant to recover for the fire loss, the landlord will most probably Choices: I. recover, because the fire spread from an adjoining building, making the owner of that building responsible for the damage. II. recover, because the dentist failed to pay rent, which technically broke the lease agreement. III. not recover, because the covenant to provide fire insurance did not run with the land.

The building was old and badly in need of renovation. To finance the improvements, the investor borrowed $125,000 from his friend. As consideration for the loan, the investor executed a promissory note for $125,000 payable to the friend in one year and secured by a mortgage on the building. The mortgage was dated January 1, and was recorded January 2. Thereafter, on February 1, the investor executed a deed absolute on the building and named the friend as grantee. This deed, although absolute in form, was intended only as additional security for the payment of the debt. In order to make judicial foreclosure unnecessary and to eliminate the right to redeem, the investor then delivered the deed to his nephew in escrow with instructions to deliver the deed to the friend if the investor failed to pay his promissory note at maturity.

A four-lane highway adjoined the orchard directly to the east.

The robberies were carried out by a single individual who entered the banks wearing a ski mask and carrying a machine gun. The police received information from a reliable informant that the defendant was the person responsible for the robberies. Acting on this tip, the police secured a valid arrest warrant and went to the defendant's home to apprehend him. When the officers rang the doorbell, the defendant opened the door and was placed under arrest. The defendant, who was wearing only underwear, asked the officers if he could put on a shirt and pants. One of the police officers asked the defendant if anyone else was present in the house. The defendant indicated that he was alone. The officer then accompanied the defendant to his bedroom to change his clothes. When the defendant asked permission to enter the closet for his pants, the officer told him that he needed to inspect the closet first. While the officer was inside the closet, he saw a ski mask that he recognized as part of the apparel worn by the bank robber. The officer confiscated the ski mask and then allowed the defendant inside the closet to change his clothes. While the officer and the defendant were in the bedroom, the officer's partner decided to conduct a protective sweep of the other rooms of the dwelling to see if any accomplices were present. Upon entering a back storage room, the other officer saw a box containing a large amount of $100 bills. The officer confiscated the money, which was later determined to be part of the money stolen during one of the bank robberies. The defendant is subsequently prosecuted for bank robbery.

The officer was lawfully present in the closet because he had a warrant to arrest the defendant and was accompanying him to change clothes.\n\n* **Money:** The discovery of the money was unlawful. The officer's protective sweep of the house was likely excessive. While protective sweeps are permissible in certain circumstances, they are generally limited to areas immediately adjacent to the place of arrest where a person could be hiding.

A downward slope exists from the landowner's land to the brother'sland. The aunt, the owner in the middle of the three lots, was an amateur scientist. She began experimentation with electricity, using a lightning rod to conduct her experiments. Frequently, the electrical storms apparently originated in and over the area within which the brother's land is located. Because of this, the aunt would often angle her rod over the fence between her property and the brother's property to maximize her chances of success. After one entire rainy and windy season of experiments, the brother had grown tired of the aunt's lightning-rod intrusions because they interfered with his ham radio operations in his garage. The brother brought suit to enjoin such lightning-rod experiments. At trial, it was found that the aunt had been conducting her activities in the airspace directly above the brother's land.

After lecturing for the bar review course for 10 years, the professor was suddenly fired. Because the professor was such a popular and well-respected individual in the bar review industry, there was much speculation and interest concerning his termination. A reporter for the local law journal telephoned the bar review course's administrative director and inquired why the professor had been fired. The director told the reporter that the professor was fired because the president of the bar review course believed that the professor had embezzled money.

He decided to buy a car and asked his father to accompany him as he looked for a car to purchase. After visiting a number of car lots, the son finally found a used car to his liking.

He raised $1 million from various sources to fund the project. After searching for a vacant lot that would be sufficient for development, the developer concluded that there was not a suitable vacant lot available. Reluctantly, the developer concluded that he would have to purchase a developed lot, have the existing structures removed, and then build the apartment house. The developer was reluctant to do this, because he had not budgeted for the additional cost of buying a developed property and removing the development. After a search for an appropriate parcel, the developer purchased a large lot, developed with a single-story residential home, for $200,000. He then spent $50,000 having the residential home removed from the lot. Knowing that it would cost approximately $850,000 to build the apartment house, the developer realized he would need to raise another $100,000. He approached an investor about lending him $100,000. The investor was apprehensive about the project because the developer had not yet lined up a construction firm to build the apartment house.

The deed was never recorded by the neighbor. Because the boss didn't own a car, she never used the driveway. Similarly, the neighbor never used the driveway because he unexpectedly had his driver's license suspended shortly after executing the above instrument. The boss died intestate on May 1, 2001, leaving her daughter as her sole heir. Following her mother's death, the daughter moved into the house on May 2, 2001. On June 1, 2001 the neighbor sold lot 2 to a professor by a deed that contained no mention of the driveway located on lot 1. The neighbor and the professor assumed that the latter had the right to use the driveway, so they didn't insert any recitations in their deed instrument regarding the driveway.

They had been employed by the casino for four years. One day, they were unexpectedly fired by the casino's new manager. Apparently, the casino hired the new manager to get rid of some of the old-time employees and replace them with new personnel at a lower wage. Angered by their firing, the codefendants vowed to get back at the casino. As their revenge, they decided to plant a bomb in the casino and demand $1,000,000. After receiving the money, they would then reveal the location of the bomb and provide details for defusing it. The co-defendants agreed that the casino should be given adequate warning so that nobody would be injured. In accordance with their plan, one of the co-defendants, who was an electronics expert, built the bomb himself. He alone then drove to the casino where he placed the bomb in a hallway closet. Shortly thereafter, the other co-defendant phoned the casino and made a demand for the money. He said a bomb was in the casino and that it would explode in 24 hours unless the money was paid. The casino treated their demand as a crank call and refused to make any payment. With their plans having gone awry, the codefendants agreed that one of them should return to the casino and defuse the bomb. As one of the co-defendants was driving back to the casino, the bomb exploded, killing 30 people. A subsequent investigation revealed that a faulty wire caused the bomb to detonate prematurely. A state statute provides that detonating or attempting to detonate a bomb or explosive device in or near a building or dwelling is a felony. If the co-defendants are charged with violating the aforementioned statute, which of the following statements is correct? Choices: I.

II. Both are guilty, because each participated in the planning of the crime. III. Both are not guilty, because they intended to defuse the bomb before it exploded. IV. Only the co-defendant who built the bomb is guilty, because he physically placed the bomb in the casino. V. Neither is guilty, because the casino's gross negligence in failing to heed the telephone warning constituted an independent intervening cause of the explosion. VI. Neither is guilty, because they did not intend for anyone to be killed, but the bomb exploded prematurely. VII. Both are guilty, but only the one who built the bomb is guilty of a felony. VIII.

Although it is not the only lake in the county, it is the largest and most scenic, and it attracts visitors from miles around. One of its biggest assets is the excellent fishing and boating, which is available to the public at large. Three years ago, in order to enhance the recreational aspects of the lake, the county leased a sizable portion of the lake and surrounding parkland to a company owned by the most prominent family in the county. The lease required the company to construct and operate a first-rate yacht house and club, complete with bar, restaurant, and private marina, and to pay the county 10% of its net profits as rent. The company set up bylaws, which were reviewed and approved by the county at the time the lease was negotiated. According to the bylaws, the yacht club, complete with its restaurant and bar, would be open to members only, and the membership committee was empowered to set up strict membership \"standards,\" as well as the cost of membership fees and dues. Upon completion of the facilities, the state granted the company a license to sell alcoholic beverages in its restaurant and bar. The membership committee announced that the membership fee was $5,000 and the monthly dues $75. Furthermore, the membership committee had a policy of approving only membership applications from men, while disapproving and denying all applications from women.

If a private entity performs a function that is traditionally or exclusively performed by the government, it may be subject to constitutional limitations. In this case, the county leased public parkland and granted the company a license to sell alcohol, suggesting a significant public function.\n\n* **Discriminatory Intent:** To prevail, the plaintiff must prove that the company's policy of excluding women is based on gender discrimination.

When she arrived, the graduate was told that her job was contingent on passing the state bar examination, which was being offered in July. In preparing for the bar examination, the graduate planned to take a bar review course. Although she had not pre-enrolled, the graduate planned to attend and pay for the course at registration. On the morning the course was set to begin, the graduate arrived late after getting stuck in freeway traffic. By the time the graduate got to the course location, registration had already been completed. When the graduate looked into the room where the course was being conducted, she saw the lecture had begun, and everyone was inside busily taking notes. Panicky, the graduate picked up a set of course materials that were lying on the registration table and entered without paying. Although the graduate intended to pay the enrollment fee, no one was at the registration table to take her money. After attending the first couple of classes, the graduate sent a cashier's check for the full amount of the enrollment fee to the bar review company. Unbeknownst to the graduate, the bar review course's regional director noticed that she had entered the lectures without paying. After ascertaining her identity from a fellow student who knew the graduate, the company filed a complaint with the local prosecutor, and a warrant was issued for her arrest. The complaint charged the graduate with the crime of larceny by trick, for deliberately failing to pay for services rendered. After the complaint was issued, the graduate's check arrived at the company's office. The company deposited the check but failed to inform the prosecutor that payment had been received. The graduate was arrested and held in custody overnight before the matter was resolved. The graduate suffered severe emotional distress at the publicity she received in the local newspapers and the humiliation she suffered for being arrested and held in police custody.

The president of a development company is interested in purchasing three of the four parcels. The president buys the three parcels from the farmer and begins formulating plans for constructing single-family dwelling units on the land. The original deed between the farmer and the development company contains a provision expressly binding \"upon all subsequent grantees, their heirs, and assigns,\" stipulating that any further subdivisions by any such persons shall be restricted to minimum two-acre lots to be used for single- family dwelling units only. The development company immediately subdivided two of the parcels into lots of three, four, and five acres, and began construction of homes thereon. The original deed restrictions were enumerated within the special warranty deeds and were given to the purchasers of the homes in the new development, called phase 1. Two years later, the president sold the remaining parcel, which had not been included in the phase 1 subdivision plan, to a contractor. The contractor, in turn, drafted a subdivision plan for the last 250-acre parcel, dividing it into one-acre lots. The contractor then commenced construction of single-family dwelling units in the new development, to be known as phase 2. There was no mention of the restriction for two-acre minimum lots in the deeds to the purchasers of the new homes in phase 2. Meanwhile, after the farmer's death, his estate isrequired to sell the remaining 250-acre parcel of his farmland. The buyer is an investor, who proposes to construct a two-level shopping center and parking lot on the property. The area surrounding phase 1 and phase 2 was rezoned for commercial and industrial uses in 2010. The investor's shopping center has grown to include 150 stores.

II. the restrictions are still enforceable, but only for the original buyers from the development company. III. the restrictions could be enforceable if the court considers the medical practice as a commercial enterprise. IV. the restrictions are not enforceable because they were not mentioned in the deeds to the buyers of phase 2 homes. V. the restrictions are not enforceable because the investor was able to construct a shopping center on the remaining farmland. VI. the restrictions would no longer be enforceable because the medical practice is considered a necessary service for the community. VII. the restrictions would no longer be enforceable, because of the change in the character of the neighborhood. VIII. the restrictions are still enforceable, thus preventing such commercial use. IX. the restrictions would no longer be enforceable, because the offering of personal services (i. e. , medical) would be a conforming use.

While in prison, federal authorities began investigating the murder of the defendant's 11-year- old stepdaughter who was murdered two years earlier. Believing that the defendant was responsible for this killing, federal agents decided to plant an informant at the prison to befriend the defendant and possibly obtain evidence about the crime. In accord with this plan, the federal agents hired a paid informant and placed him in the prison as a fellow inmate, masquerading as an organized crime figure. The informant soon befriended the defendant and learned that he was being threatened by other inmates because of a rumor that he had killed a child. The informant then raised the subject in several conversations, but the defendant repeatedly denied any such involvement. After the defendant started receiving tough treatment from other inmates because of the rumor, the informant offered to protect the defendant but told him, \"You have to tell me the truth about what really happened you know, if you want me to help you. \" Believing that the informant would protect him from the other inmates, the defendant then admitted to the informant that he had driven his stepdaughter to the desert where he killed her. Based upon this confession, the defendant was then indicted for the first-degree murder of his stepdaughter. Prior to trial, the defendant moves to suppress the statement given to the informant.

After it received an official notification of the doctor's conviction, the state medical board revoked the doctor's license without affording the doctor any opportunity for a hearing. The doctor has sued the board in state court to set aside the revocation, alleging deprivation of property without due process of law because the board did not provide an opportunity for a trial-type hearing before revoking the license.

Although the state provides both sexes with equal pay and benefits, the state has adopted a policy that prohibits the assignment of female officers to its special undercover narcotics division. This is a moderate risk position that sometimes involves violent encounters with drug dealers. Since the special narcotics division was first established, five undercover agents have been killed in the line of duty. It is because of the state's concern with the safety and well-being of its female officers that it has adopted such a policy. The woman, who desired to be a member of the narcotics division, filed an application for assignment as a special drug agent.

In September 1973, the woman mortgaged the 20 acres of timberland to the bank by a mortgage deed (in the traditional form of a conveyance in fee simple subject to a condition subsequent), which was not recorded until January 1974. The mortgage deed contained the following clause immediately after the legal description of the 20 acres of timberland:\"Together with all the real property now owned by (the woman) or which shall be owned by (the woman) during the continuance of the indebtedness secured by this mortgage. \" This mortgage was given, as the recorded instrument revealed, to secure a note for $100,000 repayable over a 40-year term. In March 2004, the woman, using money loaned by a finance company, purchased a 50-acre mountainous estate situated outside of a major city. This deed was recorded immediately. In April 2004, the woman executed and delivered to the finance company a mortgage to secure its loan. This mortgage was promptly and duly recorded. The finance company had no actual notice of the prior mortgage to the bank. In February 2007, the woman defaulted on both mortgages. The bank then initiated foreclosure proceedings against the woman and the finance company as joint defendants. In its foreclosure action, the bank averred that its mortgage was a first mortgage on both the 20 acres of timberland and the 50-acre estate. The finance company filed a cross-complaint, alleging that its mortgage was a first mortgage on the 50-acre estate and praying for foreclosure on that parcel of property.

As the highway passes through this business district, there is a stretch where the highway is too narrow to satisfS' the safety standards for state roadways. Along this narrow stretch and on opposite sides of the street are located two businesses. Situated on the east side of the street is a bar and grill; directly across the street on the west side is a lounge. In order to comply with state highway regulations, the state highway department, acting pursuant to state statute, ordered the city to prohibit parking on one side of the highway within the business district. The city council convened a special meeting to determine whether parking should be prohibited on the east or west side of the street. During the meeting, the council was unable to resolve the issue. Finally, the city council president decided the only fair way to resolve the matter was to flip a coin. After the coin flip, the city prohibited parking at all times on the west side of the highway. On account of this decision, parking in front of the lounge was permanently prohibited. This caused the lounge to suffer a substantial decline in business because of the unavailability of on-street parking. As a consequence, the owner of the lounge brought suit for declarative relief against the city alleging that the parking ban on his side of the street was unconstitutional.

No, because \"this contract may not be assigned\" means that duties may not be delegated, and the seller delegated a duty. II. No, because the non-assignment clause voids the contract when violated. III. Yes, because the buyer did not explicitly reject the toasters manufactured by the competitor. IV. No, because the seller violated the contractual prohibition by delegating its duty to a competitor. V. Yes, because even though the seller breached the contract, there are no damages since the competitor's toasters are of equal quality to the seller's toasters. VI. No, because the seller assigned a right despite the contractual prohibition. VII. Yes, because the seller informed the buyer about the change in manufacturer. VIII.

Yes, because the quality of the toaster did not change even though the manufacturer did.**\n\nHere's why:\n\n* **Non-Assignment vs. Delegation:** The contract specifically prohibits assignment, which means transferring the entire contract to another party. Delegation, on the other hand, is transferring a specific duty under the contract to another party.  \n\n* **Material Breach:**  While the seller technically breached the contract by delegating the manufacturing duty, the buyer's argument fails because the breach is not material. A material breach is one that significantly alters the contract's essential terms. In this case, the quality of the toasters remained the same.\n\n* **Buyer's Rights:** The buyer could have potentially argued for damages if the competitor's toasters were of inferior quality or if there were other significant changes to the contract.

He contacted several companies and asked them to submit bids for the installation work. An alarm company decided to submit a bid and, in turn, requested bids from several wholesalers for the burglar alarms it planned to use if it was awarded the job. A supplier submitted a bid to the alarm company that the latter used in computing the bid that it was preparing for the builder. On September 1, the alarm company sent the builder its bid, in which it proposed to install the security systems for $100,000. On September 9, the supplier notified the alarm company that it would be unable to supply any burglar alarms to them.

Thereafter, the husband accepted a new job in a neighboring state. Before relocating, the husband met with an attorney to seek his advice about how he could gain full custody of his son. The attorney told the husband that his new state did not give full faith and credit to divorce proceedings in his former state of residence.

The pharmacist established and operated a drugstore at the leased premises. The leaseincluded provisions that described the shopping center by metes and bounds; identified the entrances, parkingareas, signs, and other common facilities of the shopping center; and set out a covenant that the owner wouldnot lease any part of the shopping center to another drugstore. Last year the owner purchased a parcel of land immediately adjacent to the shopping center. That parcel wasimproved with a building that, at the time of the owner's purchase and for ten years earlier, was occupied inpart by a food supermarket and in part by a discount drugstore, under leases which the prior owner assignedto the owner. The owner reconstructed the common facilities of both shopping centers to integrate them and combine themso that, to the public, the two centers appeared as a larger single development. The pharmacist learned that the lease of the discount drugstore was about to expire and that the ownerplanned to enter into a new lease of the same space with the discount drugstore. The pharmacist protested the proposed new lease, but the owner declared his intention to go forward with it.

The boy thought the card had very little value because he knew that Rickey was not a major league baseball player. The boy accepted the 50 cents and gave the Rickey baseball card to the collector. The next day the boy found out that the baseball card was worth$600. If the boy asserts a claim against the collector for deceit, will the boy prevail? Choices: I. Yes, because the collector took advantage of the boy's lack of knowledge about the card's value. II. No, because the boy willingly accepted the offer made by the collector. III. No, because the collector made no false representations of fact. IV. Yes, because the collector was obligated to disclose the true value of the card. V. Yes, because the collector did not disclose the true value of the card. VI. Yes, because the boy was the true owner of the card and was entitled to the benefit of the bargain. VII. Yes, because the collector used his knowledge of the card's value to exploit the boy. VIII. No, because the boy had the opportunity to decline the collector's offer. IX. No, because the collector didn't force the boy to sell the card. X. No, because the boy was not justified in relying on the collector's offer. Answer:\n", "Result": "The correct answer is **I.

He decided he wanted to retire and listed his business for sale. A buyer saw the listing and visited the retail business. The buyer told the owner that she was very interested in buying the business, but that she needed to get a loan from the bank to finance the purchase. The parties drafted a contract, signed by both parties, which stated that the buyer agreed to purchase the retail business from the owner for $250,000. The written agreement contained a provision wherein the sale would not take effect \"unless the buyer is successful in her bid to obtain a loan from a bank to finance the purchase of the business. \" Subsequently, the buyer made no effort to attempt to obtain a loan from a bank so that the sale could be finalized. After several months, the owner filed suit against the buyer for breach of contract. Which of the following will be the owner's strongest argument in support of his action against the buyer for breach of contract? Choices: I. The buyer breached an implied promise to make a reasonable effort to obtain a loan from a bank. II. The buyer's lack of effort in obtaining a loan is a breach of good faith and fair dealing. III. Although obtaining a loan from a bank was a condition to the buyer's duty to buy the business, the condition should be excused because its non-occurrence would cause a forfeiture to the owner. IV. The obtaining of a loan from a bank was not worded as a \"condition\" to the buyer's duty to buy the business. V. The buyer was under a duty to inform the owner of her decision not to seek a loan. VI. The owner suffered financial loss due to the buyer's inaction in seeking a loan. VII.

Although obtaining a loan from a bank was a condition to the buyer's duty to buy the business, the condition should be excused because its non-occurrence would cause a forfeiture to the owner.**\n\nHere's why:\n\n* **Conditions in Contracts:**  A condition precedent in a contract is an event that must occur before a party's duty to perform arises. In this case, the buyer's duty to buy the business was conditioned on her obtaining a loan.\n\n* **Forfeiture:**  Forfeiture occurs when a party loses their rights or benefits under a contract due to a technicality or an event outside their control. Courts generally disfavor forfeiture clauses that result in an unfair outcome.\n\n* **Balancing Interests:**  While the contract clearly stated the condition, the court might consider it unfair to allow the buyer to avoid the contract simply by not applying for a loan.

Located below the ranch is an estate that is owned by a millionaire. A stream is a non-navigable watercourse that originates at the top of the mountain and runs all the way down into a valley. Both the ranch and the estate are within the watershed of the stream. When the millionaire purchased the estate in 1956, he started taking water from the stream and used it to irrigate the southern half of his property, which he has used as a farm. Prior to 1956, the southern half of the estate had been cleared and placed in cultivation, while the northern half remained wooded and virtually unused. The millionaire continued this established pattern of use and has never stopped using the water in this way. In 1986, the rancher built a home on the ranch and started talcing water from the stream for domestic purposes. During that year there was heavy rainfall, and this caused the stream to run down the mountain at a high water level. However, in 1987, a drought caused the stream to flow at a very low level. Consequently, there was only enough water to irrigate the millionaire's farmland or, in the alternative, to supply all of the rancher's domestic water needs and one-quarter of the millionaire's irrigation requirements. The mountain is located in a jurisdiction where the period of prescription is 15 years. The rancher is continuing to take water for his personal needs and there is insufficient water to irrigate the estate. The millionaire then brings an appropriate action in 1996 to declare that his water rights to the stream are superior to those of the rancher. In addition, the millionaire moves to have the full flow of the stream passed to him, notwithstanding the effect it might have on the rancher. If this state follows the common law of riparian rights, but does not follow the doctrine of prior appropriation, judgment should be for whom? Choices: I. The rancher, because the drought conditions give him priority access to the water. II. The rancher, because the millionaire's use of the water is excessive and unnecessary. III. The millionaire, because he obtained an easement by prescription to remove as much water as he may need. IV. The rancher, because as an upstream landowner, he would have superior rights to the water than a downstream owner. V. Neither, because both have equal rights to the water as it runs through both of their properties. VI. The rancher, because domestic use is superior to and is protected against an agricultural use. VII. The millionaire, because he put the water to a beneficial use prior to the rancher's use and has continuously used the water. VIII.

What will the Court decide? Choices: I. The Second Amendment prohibits all forms of gun control because of the need for a strong militia, and the man's lawsuit will be successful. II. Semi-automatic guns cannot be restricted in any way and the lawsuit will be successful. III. The statute is unreasonable as it infringes on the individual's right to bear arms, thus the man's lawsuit will be successful. IV. The statute is unconstitutional because it violates the Second Amendment, thus the individual's lawsuit will be successful. V. The regulation of firearms for the safety of society is an absolute, unfettered right of the state governments and the individual's lawsuit is dismissed for that reason. VI. The statute is invalid as it excessively regulates the possession and use of firearms, thus the individual's lawsuit will be successful. VII. The statute is a reasonable regulation but the individual's lawsuit will still be successful due to a technicality in the law. VIII. The Second Amendment only applies to militias, thus the individual's lawsuit will be dismissed. IX. The statute is constitutional as it aims to prevent the misuse of firearms, thus the individual's lawsuit will be dismissed. X. The statute is a reasonable regulation that will not hinder the right to possess a handgun for self-defense in the home and the individual's lawsuit will be dismissed.

In 1994, the rancher delivered to his son, for a sum of $1,000, a deed signed by the rancher, naming the son and his heirs as grantee, and appearing valid on its face. The son neglected to record the deed. In 1998, a farmer, aware of the existence of the rancher-to-son deed, sought out the rancher and asked to buy for $10,000 a deed to the orange grove from the rancher to the fanner and his heirs. The rancher executed such a deed, and the fanner promptly recorded it. The farmer's intent was to acquire color of title and obtain ownership of the orange grove by adverse possession. In 1998, the farmer constructed a fence around the orange grove. In 1999, the son presented his deed of the orange grove to a retiree, and for $15,000, paid by the retiree, signed and delivered a deed of the orange grove in favor of the retiree and his heirs. After receiving the deed, the retiree made no effort to search the title, to examine the property, or to record the deed. In 2003, a buyer paid the fanner $20,000, and the farmer delivered to the buyer a deed of the orange grove in favor of the buyer and his heirs. The buyer had examined the property, had searched the title, and had no knowledge of the farmer's awareness of the prior rancher-to-son instrument. Although the buyer did not reside on the property, he regularly visited the orange grove twice a week. The buyer recorded his deed. In 2007 for $25,000 paid by an orange grower, the retiree signed and delivered adeed of the orange grove naming the orange grower and his heirs as grantees. Before the grower had paid the retiree and taken his deed, the grower visited the orange grove and observed the fence. However, the buyer was not present when the grower visited the property and nothing suggested who \u0080\u0094if anyone \u0080\u0094was using it.

Choices: I. In a notice jurisdiction, the grower, as a subsequent bonafide purchaser, is only chargeable with notice of what appears in his chain of title and, therefore, would acquire record title to the orange grove. II. In a notice jurisdiction, the rancher retains record title to the orange grove, as he never properly conveyed his title. III. In a race-notice jurisdiction, the grower, being the last to record, would acquire record title to the orange grove. IV. In a race jurisdiction, the buyer, having recorded his deed before the grower, would acquire record title to the orange grove. V. In a race-notice jurisdiction, the son would acquire record title to the orange grove, because he is the original grantee. VI. In a notice jurisdiction, the retiree, despite not recording his deed, would acquire equitable title to the orange grove due to his payment and receipt of the deed. VII.

In a notice jurisdiction, the retiree would acquire record title to the orange grove even though he failed to record his deed. IX.

The city's agent got a commitment from a major business corporation to build a large research center in the targeted area, which would bring new jobs and increased tax revenue. The city brought eminent domain proceedings to free up some 200 acres of land in the selected area. Although the city successfully condemned most of the privately-owned properties, it failed to reach agreement with nine residential property owners. Those owners brought suit seeking an injunction to prevent the taking. They claimed that this was not a taking for \"public use\" as required by the takings clause of the Fifth Amendment; rather the government was taking their property to give it to a private company. The case reached the Supreme Court of the United States. What will the Supreme Court decide? Choices: I. The taking for economic development purposes is proper because developing the city's economy constitutes a public use. II. The taking is proper because the increase in tax revenue is a direct public benefit. III. The taking would primarily increase the business corporation's profit margins, which is insufficient to support the public use requirement. IV. The taking is proper because the creation of new jobs is a tangible public benefit. V. The taking is improper because a private industry research center is not primarily open to the public's use. VI.

He saved up some money to buy a bow and other archery equipment. He set up a target in his backyard in order to practice. He surrounded the target with stacks of hay bales to stop any arrows that missed the target. After practicing for a few weeks, the boy made great improvements in his technique and accuracy. While practicing one afternoon, however, the boy lost his balance just as he released an arrow. As a result, the arrow flew way off course, going over the target and all the hay bales and flying into a wooded area behind the boy's house. The boy assumed no one was in the woods, so he was relieved that the errant arrow would not hurt anyone. However, a hiker happened to be in the woods near the boy's house. As he paused for a moment to take a drink of water, the hiker suddenly saw something out of the corner of his eye. It was the stray arrow shot by the boy.

The female beetle would lay eggs among the roots of the cymbidiums, and it would sometimes take up to one year for the eggs to hatch. Fearing for the safety of the citrus crops in the United States, the United States government adopted a ban on the importation of all cymbidiums grown in foreign countries.

During the search, a police officer went to a home and rang the doorbell. When a teenage male opened the door, the police officer told him that a convict had escaped and asked if he had seen anyone suspicious in the neighborhood. The teenager said he hadn't but then asked the police officer to come inside to ensure the house was safe. The police officer entered the home and proceeded to look around. When he went into the kitchen, the police officer noticed a bag containing white powder on the counter. Suspecting that the bag contained narcotics, the police officer questioned the teenager as to its contents. The teenager said he didn't live in the house and had never seen it before. The police officer confiscated the bag and took the teenager to the station house for questioning, at which time it was determined that the teenager had escaped from a psychiatric hospital and had broken into the home earlier in the day. Furthermore, the results of a police lab test found that the bag contained heroin. As a result, the police issued an arrest warrant for the owner of the home. He was apprehended and charged with possession of heroin. The homeowner's attorney has filed a motion to suppress, claiming that the heroin confiscated by the police was unlawfully obtained.

By the same token, Congress has taken no action on the matter. A resident of the neighboring state has installed a radar detection device in his automobile. While driving to visit his mother he is arrested and charged with violating the aforementioned state statute. The resident files a complaint challenging the constitutionality of the state statute.

One of her largest spaces was rented on a month-to-month basis at $500 per month by a dance troop which held performances in the facility. The director of the dance troop moved to New York for a starring role Off-Broadway. Unfortunately the troop was unable to find another dance director, so it folded and vacated the space. Sally Sleazy learned of the closure and decided the location would be perfect for a topless strip joint. Sally rented the space from Loretta under a two-year lease at $1,000 per month without disclosing her intended use of the space. One month after the strip joint opened, the County Commissioners passed a new law prohibiting topless strip joints in that neighborhood.

The man reacted gruffly, telling the officer that he had no authority to stop him. There was a brief scuffle, and the officer issued two more charges, for disorderly conduct and failure to obey an officer. Eventually, the defendant pled guilty to the red light citation and the other two charges were dismissed. He then filed a federal court action against the park policeman in which he asserted a Bivens civil rights claim for false arrest and malicious prosecution. The first legal theory was that the park officer lacked authority to stop the plaintiff on a New York street and arrest him for a state traffic violation. He claimed that the officer was outside of his federal park land jurisdiction. Will the court likely uphold the authority of the park police under these facts? Choices: I. All federal officers can make arrests for all criminal offenses within a state's geographical jurisdiction under the priority status of federal law and federal law officers. II. The officer was within his authority to make the arrest, but only because the defendant acted in a disorderly manner and failed to obey an officer. III.

It is the circus's practice to finish each day's entertainment by discharging a so-called aerial bomb into the sky. After exploding, the aerial bomb emits a spectacular rainbow fireworks display that is seen for miles around. One afternoon, a 10-year-old boy and a few friends went to the fairgrounds to see the circus. After paying their admission, they were about to enter the \"big top\" when the boy came upon an aerial bomb lying on the ground. Ignorant of what the object really was, but in an exploratory mood, the boy applied a match to the fuse of the fireworks device. It exploded and seriously injured the boy. After the accident, and before the parents of the boy had retained a lawyer, the adjuster for the circus's insurance carrier contacted the parents several times, trying to negotiate a settlement of their claim against the circus. On each occasion, the adjuster told the parents there was no need for them to hire an attorney because the applicable civil code did not provide for recovery in such a situation.

The ordinance expressly exempted from its purview the singing or chanting of religious songs.

They began loudly chanting, \"We're number 1. . . we're number 1. \" One of the residents who lived on the street was greatly disturbed by the noise and reported the incident to the police, who were immediately summoned to the scene. The students who engaged in the chanting were arrested and charged with violating the ordinance. The students who were prosecuted now bring suit challenging the constitutionality of the city ordinance. Which of the following would constitute their WEAKEST argument against enforcement of the city ordinance? Choices: I. The ordinance is unjust as it discriminates against those who are not religious. II. The ordinance is invalid as it fails to consider the cultural importance of chanting and singing in a group. III.

For six months, the woman worked at the restaurant and never smoked during business hours. One afternoon, the woman was working when an armed robber stormed into the restaurant. He pointed a pistol at the woman and demanded all the money from the cash register. Frightened and panic stricken, the woman handed over the money and then collapsed. Moments later, she regained consciousness and then smoked a cigarette while she regained her composure. Thereafter, the woman resumed her duties for the rest of the day. The next week, however, when the woman received her pay check, she noticed that the restaurant had deducted $50 from her check. A note was attached indicating that the woman was being fined for smoking during business hours. Although the woman protested, the restaurant refused to make any waiver and stood by its policy. In an action by the woman against the restaurant to recover the $50, which of the following is the best argument in the woman's favor? Choices: I. The woman was not properly informed of the nonsmoking policy upon her hire, rendering the fine invalid. II. The nonsmoking provision is discriminatory as it does not take into account the personal habits or needs of the employees. III. The restaurant's nonsmoking policy concerned a collateral matter that was not incorporated within the terms of their employment contract. IV.

One year later, the employer had the employee sign a covenant not to compete for a two-year period after termination. Two years later, the employee quit and went to work for a competitor company. The prior employer sued, asking for a preliminary injunction to enforce the covenant. The employee argued that the covenant was invalid because no consideration passed to her \u0080\u0093 she could be fired at any time and did not receive anything for signing.

The director granted a logging company the privilege to cut timber on a remote portion of the tract, together with incidental easements of way.

The written contract entered included a \"payment clause,\" which provided that the videographer would be \"paid $10,000 for the filming and editing of a 60-minute video of the wedding and the reception. \" The man included in the contract a stipulation that the video would be filmed using high definition equipment. The contract made no other reference to compensation. Thereafter, the videographer filmed and edited the 60-minute video, using high definition equipment, and presented it to the man. The videographer then submitted to the man an invoice statement in the amount of $15,000. Besides the $10,000 contract figure, the bill included a $5,000 charge for the use of the high definition equipment.

Choices: I. Assuming arguendo that the written \"payment clause\" was fully integrated and neither patently nor latently ambiguous, equitable considerations require admission of extrinsic evidence, if available, of the parties' intent, since the videographer would stand to lose $5,000 on the contract.

A state trooper is a member of the state police force, a law enforcement body that exercises broad police authority throughout the state. The position of state trooper is filled on the basis of competitive examinations taken by all of the applicants. After the resident alien applied for the position, the state authorities refused him permission to take the qualifying examination. The state authorities based their refusal on state statute, which provided:\"No person shall become a member of the state police unless he/she shall be a citizen of the United States. \"Thus, under this provision, as a prerequisite to becoming a member of the state police, an alien must relinquish his foreign citizenship and become a citizen. In an opinion upholding the validity of the statute, the State Attorney General noted that since police officers fall within the category of important non-elective officials who participate directly in the execution of broad public policy, only citizens of the United States should be qualified to apply for such positions. \"At the time the resident alien applied for a position as a state trooper, he was a citizen of a foreign country and not currently eligible for citizenship. As a result of a federal statute, Congress has imposed a five-year residency requirement for the attainment of citizenship.

A state trooper is a member of the state police force, a law enforcement body that exercises broad police authority throughout the state. The position of state trooper is filled on the basis of competitive examinations taken by all of the applicants. After the resident alien applied for the position, the state authorities refused him permission to take the qualifying examination. The state authorities based their refusal on state statute, which provided:\"No person shall become a member of the state police unless he/she shall be a citizen of the United States. \"Thus, under this provision, as a prerequisite to becoming a member of the state police, an alien must relinquish his foreign citizenship and become a citizen. In an opinion upholding the validity of the statute, the State Attorney General noted that since police officers fall within the category of important non-elective officials who participate directly in the execution of broad public policy, only citizens of the United States should be qualified to apply for such positions. \"At the time the resident alien applied for a position as a state trooper, he was a citizen of a foreign country and not currently eligible for citizenship.

The state's economy used to be based solely on heavy industry. However, the state legislature approved legalized gambling within the state. As a consequence, many casinos and new hotels were built and the state's economy boomed. These moves were often induced by the granting by the state of special tax benefits for the construction of new casinos and hotels under state statutes. Recently, however, neighboring states have legalized gambling and offered greater tax incentives to the gaming industry. As a result, many of the casino and hotel owners have begun to leave the state. The unemployment and social welfare benefits the state has had to pay have substantially increased, burdening the remaining casinos, and also making it difficult for the state to lower its taxes to remain competitive with other states. On account of this predicament, the state legislature passed, and the governor duly signed, an emergency bill into law. According to the statute, the state imposed a one cent tax on the playing of any slot machine in any gambling casino. Since virtually all the slot machines required a payment of either a dime, quarter, or dollar, the imposition of this tax required a major costly adaptation on each slot machine to allow for the deposit of the additional one cent tax. Although many casino owners have complained about the tax, their only alternative is to absorb the tax themselves and lose one cent per game. As a consequence of the tax, fewer slot machines are purchased in the state by the casino owners. No manufacturer of slot machines is located in the state. Which of the following constitutional provisions provide the strongest ground to attack the validity of the state tax bill? Choices: I. The commerce clause. II. The due process clause of the Fourteenth Amendment. III. The tenth amendment's reservation of powers to the states. IV. The third amendment's prohibition against quartering soldiers. V.

For some time the rancher's cattle had been seized upon by roaming packs of wolves. In order to protect his livestock from these attacks, the rancher erected a fence around his property. In addition, the rancher installed electrical wiring on the fence. The wiring transmitted an electric current, which would emit a shock upon contact with the fence. Although the voltage was calculated to frighten animals away from the fence, it was of such low intensity that it posed no risk of injury to a human being, even a small child. Consequently, the rancher did not post any notice of the electrical wiring device. One day, a cowboy was riding his horse along the outskirts of the rancher's property, when a gust of wind blew his hat onto the fence. The cowboy, who had undergone major heart surgery, wore a pacemaker.

In the third game of the season, the team beat their archrival, and the teenager scored a record high 69 points. In the locker room following the game, the basketball coach approached the teenager and requested that he provide a urine sample for a random drug test. The teenager refused.

These items are distributed to pet stores throughout the United States and Europe. For many years, the company has conducted its operations from a large factory located in a small town in the southern part of the state. One of the businessman's biggest selling products is specially manufactured high-frequency dog-calling whistles. These whistles are sold to dog-training schools and canine divisions of many police departments. Although these whistles are not audible to people, they are audible to dogs over considerable distances. Two years ago, a breeder purchased an undeveloped lot in the small town in which the company's factory was located. On her property, the breeder constructed a pet hotel, which was used as a boarding kennel for dogs and cats. This boarding facility was situated about 100 yards from the company's factory.

The lease also stipulated that the tenant, as lessee, may not assign or sublease the said premises. The tenant and his family lived in the house for two years. Then the tenant, still owing the landlord three months back rent, assigned his leasehold interest in the property to a student, who was unaware of the prohibition against assignments.

The defendant's attorney argued that the briefcase did not belong to the defendant, and the defendant had no idea how the heroin got inside the briefcase.

In 2000, the railroad decided to discontinue operating its trains over the strip conveyed in 1955. By 2004, the growth of a nearby town had made the 300-acre cattle ranch valuable as a potential site for homes or for an industrial park. However, as of January 1, 2005, the governing body of the county (in which the ranch sits) took appropriate action, in accordance with Texas statutes, to zone the 300-acre cattle ranch as single-family residential property with a minimum lot size of one acre. The ordinance provided that the exclusion of ranching operations and industrial development was necessary to protect the health of county residents by limiting the extent of waste disposal and preventing pollution of air and the nearby river, the county's major water supply. The state's power authority has now taken appropriate action to condemn half of the 300-acre cattle ranch, which will be flooded as a result of construction of a dam for a proposed hydroelectric facility. The 150 acres taken includes the 20-acre strip described in the deed to the railroad. Is the railroad entitled to any compensation from the state's power authority? Choices: I. No, because the railroad has ceased its operations and therefore forfeited any claims to the land. II. No, because the condemnation of the land by the state's power authority overrides any previous agreements. III.

Yes, because the holder of an easement benefit is entitled to compensation for the value lost. VI. Yes, because the railroad still holds the right to the land unless it is formally relinquished. VII. Yes, because if all the leased land is condemned for the full balance of the lease term, the lessee is entitled to compensation for the taking of the leasehold estate. VIII.

The statute provides that such information must be written on the ballot in ink in an appropriate space. A write-in candidate for the office of Attorney General is a Chinese-American. The candidate is of the opinion that he needs a large turnout of Chinese voters in order to win the election. As a result, his campaign manager decides to mail to every registered Chinese voter a tear-off sticker, which bears the candidates name along with the office of Attorney General. Since many native Chinese people are not proficient in reading and writing English, the campaign manager believes that many of the voters will have difficulty writing the candidate's name and office on the ballot. As a result, the campaign manager has mounted an extensive media campaign to inform voters on how to apply the stickers to the ballot. Five months prior to the election an election official notifies the candidate's campaign committee that the tear-off stickers do not comply with the state statute. In her letter, the official explains that state election officials are of the opinion that it is necessary for potential voters to write the candidate's name in ink.

The surgeon was assisted by an intern, who was assigned to the operation by the hospital, and a nurse, who was on the staff of the hospital. During the patient's convalescence, the patient complained of pain not explicable as an ordinary post-operative symptom. On investigation, it turned out that the intern and nurse, who had worked together in bandaging him, had done so in such a way as to constrict certain blood vessels. The faulty bandaging had caused acute pain and retarded the patient's recovery. After the patient's eventual recovery, he sued the intern, claiming $20,000 in damages. Before the case went to trial, the patient and intern agreed to a settlement in which the intern paid the patient $12,000, and the patient released the intern from all further claims for liability arising out of the incident.

One of the contractors in turn sought bids from several subcontractors to determine the overall cost of the job. An electrician submitted a bid to do the electrical work to the contractor, which the contractor used in computing the bid he sent to the owner. The contractor notified the electrician to that effect. Two weeks later, the contractor submitted his bid to the owner, in which he offered to perform the renovation work for $75,000. The next day, the electrician notified the contractor that he was unable to perform the electrical work on the owner's project. Two days later, the owner sent the contractor a signed confirmation letter wherein she stated, \"I hereby accept your offer to perform the renovation work for the quoted cost of $75,000. \"Thereafter, the contractor hired another electrician to complete the electrical work at a cost of $5,000 above the first electrician's bid. The contractor explained the situation to the owner and informed her that the overall cost of the job would have to be increased to $80,000.

A man was arrested and charged with the crime of drug addiction. Two officers testified that they examined \"track\" marks on the defendant's arms and wrists, and that he admitted to past drug usage. The accused testified that he was not an addict and the marks were from an allergic reaction. The trial court instructed the jury that it could find him guilty on proof that he was an addict, without proof of drug usage. The jury did not believe the defendant's denials, and found him guilty based on the observed track marks. The court sentenced him to six months imprisonment. He appealed, claiming cruel and unusual punishment prohibited by the Eighth and Fourteenth Amendments of the United States Constitution. Will the conviction likely be reversed on appeal? Choices: I. No, because the state has the right to protect its citizens from the harmful effects of narcotics. II. Yes, because the physical evidence is not enough to prove that the defendant is currently using drugs. III. Yes, because addiction is a medical condition and should be treated as such, not criminalized. IV. No, because the jury found him guilty based on the evidence presented in the trial. V. Yes, because the statute punishes having the illness of drug addiction, which is like punishing someone for having a cold, and it is thus cruel and unusual punishment. VI. Yes, because the statute makes it criminal to use illegal drugs, which constitutes cruel and unusual punishment. VII. No, because the defendant admitted to past drug usage, hence he is guilty. VIII.

For many years, the retiree grew tobacco on a 10-acre strip located in the northeast section of the property. In March, the retiree planted his annual tobacco crop, which he usually harvested in early October. In September, the retiree sold his farm to a tobacco grower for $100,000. At the time the retiree conveyed the property to the grower, the tobacco crop was well developed and quite mature. When the retiree and the grower entered into their land-sale agreement, there was no mention of the status or ownership of the tobacco crop. In early October, after the grower took possession of the property, the retiree contacted him and requested permission to harvest and remove the tobacco crop. The grower refused to allow the retiree to re-enter the property. The retiree brings suit against the grower seeking to re-enter the property and remove the tobacco crop that he had planted. Which of the following is correct regarding the respective rights of the parties? Choices: I. Both the retiree and the grower are entitled to an equal share of the tobacco crop, thus, the retiree should be allowed to re-enter the property to harvest. II.
