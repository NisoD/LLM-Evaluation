The statute provides that such information must be written on the ballot in ink inan appropriate space. A write-in candidate is a German-American and is of the opinion that he needs a large turnout of German voters in order to win the election. As a result, his campaign manager decides to mail to every registered German voter a tear-off sticker, which bears the candidate's name and office for which he is running. Since many native German people are not proficient in reading and writing English, the campaign manager believes that many of the voters will have difficulty writing the candidate's name and office on the ballot. As a result, the campaign manager has mounted an extensive media campaign to inform voters on how to apply the stickers to the ballot. Five months prior to the election an election official notifies the candidate's campaign committee that the tear-off stickers do not comply with the state statute. In her letter, the official explains that state election officials are of the opinion that it is necessary for potential voters to write the candidate's name in ink. Therefore, she concludes that the stickers do not comply with statutory requirements. Three weeks later, the candidate filed suit in federal district court against state election officials, claiming that their interpretation of the state statute violates the U. S. Constitution. Which of the following sets forth the strongest constitutional argument the candidate could make against the interpretation of the statute by the state officials? Choices: 1. It unreasonably discriminates against German voters who lack a proficiency in the English language. 2. It unreasonably interferes with the exclusive federal election power as embodied in the Fifteenth Amendment. 3.

It violates the Equal Protection Clause by treating write-in candidates differently. 6. It unreasonably discriminates against write-in candidates for public office. 7. It unreasonably limits the means by which a candidate can campaign, infringing on democratic practices. 8. It unreasonably restricts freedom of speech as guaranteed by the First Amendment. 9.

The widower lived in a farmhouse on the lemon grove and used the property to raise produce. Adjoining the lemon grove directly to the west was a 10-acre farm that was owned in fee simple by a farmer. There was a four-lane highway that adjoined the lemon grove directly to the east. The widower, by way of gift, executed a deed naming his daughter as grantee. The deed granted to the daughter and her heirs an antebellum mansion located near the southern edge of the lemon grove. The antebellum mansion was accessible by a little- used road that ran west to east from the farmlgrove border to the four-lane highway along the southern boundary of the grove. The daughter recorded her deed and took immediate possession of the property. A short while later, the daughter and the farmer fell in love and began seeing each other quite frequently. In order for the farmer to reach the daughter's house, it was necessary for him to travel over the little-used road across the lemon grove. Many years later, the farmer, who was still having an affair with the daughter, met her father at a Rotary Club meeting. They struck up a conversation, and the widower asked the farmer, \"Have you been driving your pickup along that little-used back road on my property?\" The farmer, who was afraid to tell the widower about his love affair with the daughter, responded with a half-truth, \"Yes, I've been using it as a shortcut to the four-lane highway. \" Unaware that the farmer was also using the path to get to the antebellum mansion to see the daughter, the widower said, \"No problem, I just wanted to be sure that it was you who was using the road. \"Thereafter, the widower found out about his daughter's relationship with the farmer.

The first cousin put up his interest in the joint tenancy as security for a $20,000 loan and signed a judgment note. It was later entered as a judgment against the first cousin's interest in the real estate. The first cousin died a year later. The second cousin decided to sell the property, but the mortgagee filed an action to prevent the sale and to enforce his interest in the property. The second cousin defended on the basis that any lien on the first cousin's interest in the property was extinguished on the first cousin's death. Will the court enforce the lien of the mortgagee against the sale of the property by the surviving second cousin? Choices: 1. Yes, because the second cousin's assent to the judgment lien was presumed by law and that assent destroyed the joint tenancy. 2. Yes, because the mortgagee has the right to enforce his interest in the property to recover the loan. 3. No, because a joint tenant cannot legally file a judgment note on just that joint tenant's interest because it would be an unconstitutional interference with the other's property rights. 4. No, because when the first cousin died the second cousin became the sole owner due to the right of survivorship, as per the joint tenancy which was still fully intact. 5.

The court might find he didn't intend to permanently deprive the woman of her share of the car.\n\n* **Criminal Mischief:** This crime involves intentionally damaging property belonging to another.  The man's actions of crashing the car, even in a fit of anger, clearly meet this definition.

The owner entered into a valid written brokerage agreement with a real estate broker. According to terms of the agreement, the broker promised to undertake best efforts to sell the estate for a purchase price of not less than $1,250,000. The contract also provided that the broker was to be paid a commission of 5 percent on the gross sale price following the consummation of the sale and transfer of title. The brokerage agreement was effective for a period of two months. One month later, the broker notified the owner that she had found a buyer who wanted to purchase the property for $1,500,000. That same day, the broker handed the owner a real estate sales contract, signed by the buyer, in which the buyer agreed to pay $1,500,000 for the purchase of the estate. The owner investigated the buyer and discovered he had sufficient funds to purchase the estate. However, the owner changed his mind and decided not to sell the property. He told the broker that he would not sign the agreement. In addition, the owner told the broker that he was canceling their brokerage agreement because he was withdrawing the estate from the market. The owner also refused to pay the broker any commission. If the broker now sues the owner for breach of contract, which of the following, if anything, is the broker's proper measure of recovery?

Some passengers got off the train, and others got on. A few moments later, a train conductor shouted, \"All aboard!\" to indicate that the train was about to depart the station. At that moment, a man, carrying a large cardboard box, came running through the station toward the train \"Wait for me!\" he shouted as he ran toward the train. The man with the box reached the edge of the platform, next to the train, just as the train started to move. The man hesitated, unsure of whether he should give up or go ahead and jump onto the train even though it was moving. A railroad worker, who happened to be standing next to the train, decided to be helpful. He said, \"You can make it,\" and gave the man a shove toward the open door of the train. The man stumbled and dropped the box that he was carrying. Instantly, the box made a loud screeching noise. The box contained powerful fireworks, and the impact of the box hitting the ground had caused a large rocket to ignite. The rocket flew out of the box and shot across the train station, glancing off the ceiling and finally crashing into a wall of a small coffee shop on the far side of the train station, about 150 feet from the train.

The break-in allegedly occurred late one evening after the store had closed for business. The defendant was identified as the perpetrator of the crime by a film that was recorded during the burglary from a hidden camera. When the defendant was apprehended, he denied involvement in the crime and told the arresting officers that he had been out of town when the burglary occurred. Prior to trial, the defendant's court appointed attorney filed a motion requesting discovery of the videotape film that was recorded during the perpetration of the crime. The trial judge granted the request and ordered the prosecution to send a duplicate copy of the videotape to the defendant's attorney. Following the judge's ruling, the prosecuting attorney, pursuant to state law, then filed a discovery motion specifically asking the defendant whether he planned to raise an alibi defense. The prosecuting attorney also sought discovery of the identity of such an alibi witness. Assume that the judge requires the defendant to respond as to whether the defendant intends to raise an alibi defense.

His will devised his estate in a Midwestern state to his son and daughter \"to share and share alike as tenants in common. \"At the time of their father's death, the daughter lived in a different part of the Midwestern state (in which the estate was located) while the son resided in a state in the Southwest. After the funeral, the daughter returned to her own residence, but the son decided to occupy the estate. He put his name on the mailbox and has paid the taxes and maintenance expenses. The daughter has been generally aware of this, but because she cared little about the estate, the daughter has never pressed her brother about the property. Since 1985, the daughter has not paid any rent or other compensation to her brother, nor has he requested such payment. In January 2010, a series of disputes arose between the son and daughter for the first time concerning their respective rights to the estate. The state in which the property is located recognizes the usual common law types of cotenancies and there is no applicable legislation on the subject.

If the Midwestern states in which the property is located has an ordinary 20-year adverse possession statute, judgment should be for whom? Choices: 1.

At the time of the father's death, he believed that he owned all of the 100-acre tract. However, the father actually owned 95 acres of the tract. The other five acres were owned by a farmer. After taking possession of the tract, the daughter executed and delivered a warranty deed to a buyer, purporting to convey all 100 acres of the tract. The agreed purchase price was $100,000. According to the terms of the sale, the buyer paid the daughter a down payment of $25,000, with the unpaid portion of the purchase price (i. e. , $75,000) secured by a mortgage.

In 1994, the farmer delivered to his son, for a sum of $1,000, a deed signed by the farmer, naming the son and his heirs as grantee, and appearing valid on its face. The son neglected to record the deed. In 1998, an investor, aware of the existence of the farmer-to-son deed, sought out the farmer and asked to buy for $10,000 a deed of the farm from the farmer to the investor and his heirs. The farmer executed such a deed, and the investor promptly recorded it. The investor's intent was to acquire color of title and obtain ownership of the farm by adverse possession. In 1998, the investor constructed a fence around the farm. In 1999, the son presented his deed of the farm to a rancher and, for $15,000, paid by the rancher, signed and delivered a deed of the farm in favor of the rancher and his heirs. After receiving the deed, the rancher made no effort to search the title, to examine the property, or to record the deed. In 2003, a teacher paid the investor $20,000, and the investor delivered to the teacher a deed of the farm in favor of the teacher and his heirs. The teacher had examined the property, had searched the title, and was aware of the prior farmer-to-son instrument. Although the teacher did not reside on the property,he regularly visited the farm twice a week. The teacher recorded his deed. In 2007, for $25,000, paid by a professor, the rancher signed and delivered a deed of the farm naming the professor and his heirs as grantees.

The suspect had attention deficit disorder, dyslexia and an IQ of 72. Prior to beginning they read a list of Miranda rights to him on a form that the suspect had in front of him. After the reading, he initialed each paragraph indicating he understood. At the bottom of the form was an express written waiver of the Miranda rights, which he signed. He had been interrogated in the past and was familiar with the procedure. During the four hours of interrogation he was given bathroom breaks, coffee, and a sandwich.

Deciding that she had had enough of married life, and desiring to spend more time with her boyfriend, she began to plan an early and unexpected demise for her husband. The woman devised a scheme whereby she would contaminate her husband's guacamole with a poisonous substance called strychnine. To facilitate her plan, she enlisted the help of her boyfriend. At first, the boyfriend adamantly refused to go along with her scheme, but when the woman threatened to break off their relationship, he reluctantly agreed. The boyfriend, a pre-med student, got the strychnine from the pharmacy by telling them that he was using it for an experiment with rats. The boyfriend then gave the strychnine to the woman, who sprinkled it in her husband's guacamole. The husband died from the poisoning. A statute in the jurisdiction provides: \"Any intentional and premeditated killing or one occurring during the perpetration of a felony, is murder in the first degree. Murder in the second degree is murder with intent to cause serious bodily harm.

The agreed upon price was $250,000, with construction to be completed within four months. Two weeks after the building contract was formed, the builder contacted a lumber yard to purchase wood necessary for the construction of the house. The builder and the owner of the lumber yard entered into a valid written agreement whereby the lumber yard was to supply the necessary lumber in exchange for $10,000, payable by the builder within 30 days. One week later, a fire destroyed a good portion of the lumber yard's supply of lumber. As a result, the lumber yard refused to supply lumber to the builder. The builder was unable to find another supplier of lumber and therefore notified the woman that he would be unable to complete her building on time. If the woman sues the owner of the lumber yard for breach of contract, will she prevail? Choices: 1.

Four years ago, in order to enhance the recreational aspects of this land, the county leased most of it to a company. The lease required the company to construct and operate a first-rate luxury hotel \u0080\u0094complete with bar, restaurant, and private marina \u0080\u0094and to pay the county 15% of its net profits as rent. The company set up management and operations bylaws for its new hotel, which were reviewed and approved by the county at the time the lease was negotiated. Upon completion of the facilities, the state granted the company a license to sell alcoholic beverages in its restaurant and bar. The hotel announced that the least expensive room was $1,000 per night. Much of the population in the county cannot afford to stay at the new hotel. One resident who cannot afford to pay the hotel fees brings an action against the company, claiming that the high fees operate to discriminate against the poor, in violation of the constitutional right to equal protection. What is the most likely result of this action? Choices: 1. The company will win, as private entities have the right to set their own prices for services. 2. The company will win, because hotel privileges are not an important or basic enough deprivation, for those unable to pay for them, to be held to violate equal protection. 3. The resident will win because the hotel's high fees are in violation of the county's leasing agreement. 4. The resident will win, as the high fees constitute a form of economic discrimination. 5.

As it grew dark and the snow continued, he realized he was completely lost. He felt sure that he would freeze to death during the night. When all hope seemed lost, he stumbled across a small cabin. He knocked on the door, but no one answered. He tried to open the door, realized it was not locked, and went inside. In the cabin, he found some food to eat and some blankets that kept him warm through the night. By the next morning, the snow had stopped, and he was able to make his way out of the forest. If the owner of the cabin sues the hiker, seeking to recover damages for the cost of the food and for the use of his cabin, what is the most likely outcome of the case? Choices: 1. The hiker does not owe anything because he was not aware of the cabin's ownership. 2. The hiker must pay for the cost of the food and an additional charge for the inconvenience. 3. The hiker must pay for the cost of the food, but nothing else. 4. The hiker must pay for the cost of the food, the use of the cabin, and any damage caused. 5. The hiker does not owe anything because the importance of his survival outweighs the property interests of the cabin owner. 6.

This doctrine allows individuals to trespass or violate property rights in order to prevent imminent harm to themselves or others.  The hiker was facing a life-threatening situation (freezing to death) and the cabin provided a necessary means of survival.\n\n* **Proportionality:** While the hiker's actions were justified, the law aims to balance the hiker's need for survival with the cabin owner's property rights.  The hiker is likely to be held responsible for the cost of the food consumed, as this is a direct and reasonable expense incurred due to his actions.\n\n* **Other Damages:**  The hiker is unlikely to be held liable for damages beyond the cost of the food.

A senator, in his investigation of communist infiltration of national labor unions, found a provision in a statute passed by Congress, which makes it a crime for a member of the communist party to act as an official of a labor union. After a subsequent legislative hearing, the communist is dismissed from his position by the union. Which of the following most accurately summarizes the applicable rule of constitutional law regarding the aforementioned provision of the statute? Choices: 1. The statutory provision is a violation of the person's Eighth Amendment right against cruel and unusual punishment. 2. The statutory provision is a violation of the person's Sixth Amendment right to a fair trial. 3. The statutory provision in the act is a form of legislative punishment violative of the Constitution as a bill of attainder. 4. Making it a crime for a Communist to hold a union office is a suspect classification, which violates the equal protection clause. 5. The statutory prohibition is a reasonable method of discrimination since the benefit to the public outweighs the injury or restrictions that would be inflicted upon the person. 6. The statute is valid as it is a reasonable restriction on the First Amendment rights of an individual in the interest of national security. 7.

He left the tavern in an intoxicated condition and then drove off to make his final delivery.

Before the swearing-in ceremony, however, the graduate received a letter from the bar examiners indicating that his admission would be delayed until a character fitness investigation had been completed. The examiners also requested information as to whether the graduate had ever been arrested, convicted, or placed on probation for a criminal offense. The graduate had been arrested as a juvenile for possession of marijuana. He was placed in a special drug education program for first- time juvenile offenders and was told that the arrest would be expunged. Since the graduate believed that he had been totally exonerated of criminal liability, he didn't report the arrest on his bar application form. The bar examiners had, in fact, received an anonymous letter making reference to the graduate's juvenile arrest and suggesting that he was not morally fit to be admitted as an attorney. In addition, the letter provided detailed information about the facts related to the offense. As a result, the examiners hired a special investigator, to look into the matter. As part of the investigator's inquiry, he went to the clerk of the juvenile court where the offense occurred and demanded access to the records concerning the graduate. The clerk refused, citing a state statute that required all court and police records relating to juveniles be sealed. After all other attempts to gain access to the records proved futile, the bar examiners filed suit in federal district court demanding access to the relevant documents. The court should rule that, as applied to this case, the state statute regarding the sealing of juvenile records is Choices: 1. constitutional, because it safeguards the principle of rehabilitation by shielding individuals from their past juvenile offenses. 2. constitutional, because the state has a strong and legitimate interest in rehabilitating juvenile offenders, and this is furthered by protecting them from embarrassment in later life through revelation ofjuvenile offenses. 3. constitutional, because it protects the privacy rights of individuals who committed offenses as minors. 4. constitutional, because it promotes the principle of 'forgetting' past juvenile indiscretions to enable successful reintegration into society. 5. unconstitutional, because it infringes on the federal court's jurisdiction over bar admission matters. 6. unconstitutional, because it violates the right of the bar examiners to fully investigate the character of applicants. 7. constitutional, because juveniles are entitled to the equal protection of the laws. 8. unconstitutional, because the bar examiners, as a quasi-judicial agency, is entitled to haveaccess to all relevant public documents. 9. unconstitutional, because it hinders the interests of justice by preventing the bar examiners from determining the fitness of candidates to practice law.

The so-called installment land contract has been popular as a substitute for the mortgage or deed of trust. Under such a contract, the seller agrees to accept, and the buyer agrees to pay, the purchase price in installments over a stipulated period of time. The vendor retains legal title as security for the payment of the purchase price; and the vendee has equitable title under the doctrine of equitable conversion. The most important characteristic of the installment land contract, however, is the forfeiture clause, which provides that if the vendee is in default for 30 days, the vendor may, at his option, declare a forfeiture of the contract, in which case all payments made shall be forfeited as \"liquidated\" damages and the buyer shall become a tenant at will of the seller. Over the years, many sellers of property under such installment land contracts have declared forfeitures in situations where the prospective buyers were delinquent in their payments, even when the buyer was late with a single payment after nearly all the other payments had been made. In order to remedy this inequitable situation, the state legislature enacted a statute requiring any seller attempting to declare a forfeiture of an installment land contract to do so by instituting a formal foreclosure action in the courts. The new law also provided that prior to the commencement of such a foreclosure action, the seller under such an arrangement must give the buyer a 60-day grace period to make up any delinquent installment payment with interest. The new law expressly applied both to installment land contracts entered into subsequent to its enactment and to installment land contracts already in existence at the time of its enactment. Is this new state statute likely to be held constitutional? Choices: 1. No, because application of the law to installment land contracts entered into before or after its enactment is a deprivation of a proprietary interest without due process of the law. 2.

The knife severed an artery, causing the father to lose a lot of blood. The mother telephoned their family doctor, who instructed her to drive the father to the local hospital. The doctor indicated that he would meet them there. A short time later at the hospital, the doctor treated the father and bandaged his hand. However, due to the fact that the father had lost a considerable amount of blood, the doctor ordered an immediate blood transfusion. After determining that the father's blood type was A-positive, the doctor orally instructed a nurse, who was employed by the hospital, to obtain the necessary blood for the transfusion. The nurse followed the doctor's instructions and telephoned the hospital's blood bank department and ordered a unit of A-positive blood. The person in the blood bank who received the nurse's call correctly wrote down the order for A-positive blood. However, someone working at the blood bank, whose identity cannot be determined, made an error in filling the order and labeling the unit of blood for the father. As a result, the blood bank sent a unit of B-positive blood mislabeled as A-positive blood. After being administered the wrong blood, the father died.

Although all the victims had apparently died from poisoning, the police were in a quandary as to who was responsible for the killings. There was finally a breakthrough in the investigation when a police toxicologist determined that all the victims had died after eating poisoned apples which had been purchased at a local market. The apples had all been contaminated with a pesticide. The police then received a letter from a person who claimed responsibility for the poisonings. The letter stated that the killings were in retaliation for the city's new policy of prosecuting toxic polluters. Acting upon an anonymous tip, the police arrested the owner of a pest control company engaged in the manufacture of pesticides, and charged him with 20 counts of murder. Thereafter, the city's largest newspaper ran a series of articles on the killings and referred to the owner as the pesticide poisoner.

The landlord leases the land and building thereon to a tenant for a term of seven years, commencing on August 1, 2001, and terminating at midnight on July 31, 2008. The lease contains the following provisions\"(1) The tenant covenants to keep the building on the leased premises insured against fire in the amount of $100,000. \"After three years of the lease had expired, the tenant assigned the entire balance of the lease period to a doctor, who took immediate possession of the leased property. Then in 2005, the doctor assigned his leasehold interest to a dentist. The dentist went into possession, but failed to pay any rent for two months. Soon afterwards, a fire spread from an adjoining building to the leased property, completely destroying the building thereon. While the tenant was in possession of the leased property, he carried a fire insurance policy on the premises in the amount of $100,000. However, the tenant allowed the policy to lapse after his assignment to the doctor. The doctor did carry insurance on the leased building, but only in the amount of $50,000. When the dentist took possession of the building, he did not obtain any fire insurance. The landlord learned that the building was not insured at the time of the fire as per the original agreement. In an action by the landlord against the tenant to recover for the fire loss, the landlord will most probably Choices: 1. recover, because the fire spread from an adjoining building, making the owner of that building responsible for the damage. 2. not recover, because the covenant to provide fire insurance did not run with the land. 3. recover, because in accordance with the Rule in Spencer's Case, the covenant to maintain fire insurance would \"touch and concern\" the land. 4. not recover, because the dentist, as assignee, would be liable for the fire loss. 5. not recover, because the doctor had partially fulfilled the obligation by providing insurance coverage of $50,000. 6. not recover, because the tenant had fulfilled his obligation by maintaining insurance during his possession of the property. 7. recover, because the dentist took possession of the property without obtaining any fire insurance. 8. recover, because the tenant's obligation to maintain fire insurance did not terminate after his assignment to the doctor. 9. recover, because the dentist failed to pay rent, which technically broke the lease agreement. 10. not recover, because the tenant no longer had control over the property after his assignment to the doctor.

The landlord leased the building and the surrounding property to a tenant for a term of six years, commencing on December 1, 2003 and terminating on November 30, 2009. On April 15, 2004, a neighbor, who owned an adjoining parcel of land, was burning leaves and underbrush on his land. There was a high wind blowing in the direction of the land that the landlord leased to the tenant, and the wind carried the burning leaves onto the tenant's property. The building caught fire and caused $150,000 in fire damages. Because of the fire, the tenant has not occupied the leased premises since the date of the fire because the building was rendered uninhabitable. This state is a common law jurisdiction. In addition, the controlling Statute of Limitations for initiating an action for damages due to negligence is five years from the time the cause of damage occurs. On May 1, 2004, the landlord brings suit against the tenant asserting breach of contract for failing to pay the rent. Judgment should be for Choices: 1. the tenant, because the landlord failed to provide a habitable living space. 2. the landlord, because the tenant is responsible for all damages to the property, regardless of the cause. 3. the tenant, because the fire was caused by a third party, not by the tenant's negligence. 4. the tenant, because it would be inequitable to enforce the rental provision in the lease because the premises was rendered uninhabitable. 5. the tenant, because the fire damage made it impossible for the tenant to use the property for its intended purpose. 6. the landlord, because the lease contract does not contain a clause relieving the tenant from paying rent in case of damages caused by external factors. 7. the tenant, because an increasing number of states have enacted statutes relieving a tenant of his obligation to pay rent where the premises are rendered uninhabitable by fire or other acts of God. 8. the landlord, because a tenant remains liable to pay rent, even though as a result of the fire, the property was rendered uninhabitable. 9. the landlord, because the covenant to pay rent runs with the land. 10. the landlord, because the tenant is responsible for the fire as it happened on their leased property.

The police received information from a reliable informant that the defendant was the person responsible for the robberies. Acting on this tip, the police secured a valid arrest warrant and went to the defendant's home to apprehend him. When the officers rang the doorbell, the defendant opened the door and was placed under arrest. The defendant, who was wearing only underwear, asked the officers if he could put on a shirt and pants. One of the police officers asked the defendant if anyone else was present in the house. The defendant indicated that he was alone. The officer then accompanied the defendant to his bedroom to change his clothes. When the defendant asked permission to enter the closet for his pants, the officer told him that he needed to inspect the closet first. While the officer was inside the closet, he saw a ski mask that he recognized as part of the apparel worn by the bank robber. The officer confiscated the ski mask and then allowed the defendant inside the closet to change his clothes. While the officer and the defendant were in the bedroom, the officer's partner decided to conduct a protective sweep of the other rooms of the dwelling to see if any accomplices were present. Upon entering a back storage room, the other officer saw a box containing a large amount of $100 bills. The officer confiscated the money, which was later determined to be part of the money stolen during one of the bank robberies. The defendant is subsequently prosecuted for bank robbery. The prosecution seeks to introduce the ski mask and the money found in his home into evidence. A motion by the defendant's attorney to exclude the items will be Choices: 1. granted with respect to the money, but denied with respect to the ski mask. 2. granted, if the defendant can prove that the police did not have a valid warrant. 3. denied, if the prosecution can prove that the police had a valid warrant. 4. granted with respect to the money, if it can be proven that it was not obtained from the robberies. 5. granted with respect to the ski mask, but denied with respect to the money. 6. denied with respect to both the ski mask and the money. 7. denied with respect to the money, if it can be proven that it was obtained from the robberies. 8. granted with respect to the ski mask, if it can be proven that it was obtained illegally. 9. denied with respect to the ski mask, if it can be proven that it was used in the robberies. 10. granted with respect to both the ski mask and the money. Answer:\n", "Result": "The correct answer is **1. granted with respect to the money, but denied with respect to the ski mask.**\n\nHere's why:\n\n* **Ski Mask:** The officer's discovery of the ski mask was a direct result of a lawful search incident to arrest.

The officer's inspection of the closet was a reasonable extension of this search.\n\n* **Money:** The discovery of the money in the storage room was not a lawful search incident to arrest. The defendant had already been arrested and was in his bedroom changing clothes. The officer's partner conducting a protective sweep of the rest of the house was not justified in this case.

However, since the student did not have a car, he rode the bus to and from the college each day. The student soon discovered that he was spending up to two hours each day to make the round trip to and from college on the bus, whereas the trip could be made in half that time if he had a car. He decided to buy a car and asked his father to accompany him as he looked for a car to purchase. After visiting a number of car lots, the son finally found a used car to his liking. However, the son only had $2,500 in his bank account, and the price of the car was $10,000. Since the son had not built up a credit history, the car lot was reluctant to sell the car to the son. The father then told the finance manager of the car lot, \"If you will sell the car to my son and for any reason he defaults on the payments, I will pay the balance due. \" The finance manager then approved the deal, which required the son to pay $2,500 down and monthly payments of $500 for 15 months.

Reluctantly, the developer concluded that he would have to purchase a developed lot, have the existing structures removed, and then build the apartment house. The developer was reluctant to do this, because he had not budgeted for the additional cost of buying a developed property and removing the development. After a search for an appropriate parcel, the developer purchased a large lot, developed with a single-story residential home, for $200,000. He then spent $50,000 having the residential home removed from the lot. Knowing that it would cost approximately $850,000 to build the apartment house, the developer realized he would need to raise another $100,000. He approached an investor about lending him $100,000. The investor was apprehensive about the project because the developer had not yet lined up a construction firm to build the apartment house. As a result, the parties signed the following written agreement:\"The investor promises to lend to the developer $100,000 at 5 percent interest within 30 days, provided the developer contracts with a construction company to build the apartment house for no more than $850,000.

The co-defendants agreed that the casino should be given adequate warning so that nobody would be injured. In accordance with their plan, one of the co-defendants, who was an electronics expert, built the bomb himself. He alone then drove to the casino where he placed the bomb in a hallway closet. Shortly thereafter, the other co-defendant phoned the casino and made a demand for the money. He said a bomb was in the casino and that it would explode in 24 hours unless the money was paid. The casino treated their demand as a crank call and refused to make any payment. With their plans having gone awry, the codefendants agreed that one of them should return to the casino and defuse the bomb.

Although it is not the only lake in the county, it is the largest and most scenic, and it attracts visitors from miles around. One of its biggest assets is the excellent fishing and boating, which is available to the public at large. Three years ago, in order to enhance the recreational aspects of the lake, the county leased a sizable portion of the lake and surrounding parkland to a company owned by the most prominent family in the county. The lease required the company to construct and operate a first-rate yacht house and club, complete with bar, restaurant, and private marina, and to pay the county 10% of its net profits as rent. The company set up bylaws, which were reviewed and approved by the county at the time the lease was negotiated. According to the bylaws, the yacht club, complete with its restaurant and bar, would be open to members only, and the membership committee was empowered to set up strict membership \"standards,\" as well as the cost of membership fees and dues.

Yes, because the graduate did not intend to defraud the company. 2. Yes, because the graduate was unfairly arrested and held in custody overnight. 3. No, because the company was within its rights to file a complaint when it noticed the graduate had attended without paying. 4. No, because filing-the complaint with the prosecutor was not outrageous conduct. 5. Yes, because the graduate ended up losing her job due to the emotional distress caused by the situation. 6. No, because the company did not intend to cause the graduate to suffer severe emotional distress. 7. Yes, because the company did not attempt to contact the graduate before filing a complaint. 8. No, because the graduate did initially attend the course without paying the enrollment fee. 9.

The contractor decided to submit a bid to do the construction. The contractor contacted all of the subcontractors she had worked with in the past, informed them of the specifics of the school construction project, and asked each to submit a bid for the work they would be requested to perform. An insulation company submitted a bid of $25,000 to do the required insulation work in the new school.

The other company charged the contractor $30,000 to do the insulation. Which of the following arguments best supports the claim for $5,000 by the contractor against the insulation company?

Violation of the statute is a misdemeanor punishable by a fine not less than $500 or more than $5,000 The state courts have interpreted this statute as a public welfare offense requiring no particular mental state for its violation. As such, this is a strict liability crime whereby culpability is imposed on a defendant for doing the proscribed act. The defendant, a recovering alcoholic, worked as a cashier at a drug store. Late one night while the defendant was working alone, he got the urge to have a drink. He opened a bottle of rum that the store sold and soon began drinking. A short time later, the defendant became inebriated and passed out. Not long thereafter, a 15-year-old girl entered the store to purchase a package of cigarettes. She took a box off the shelf and went to the cashier's counter to pay for them.

Answer:\n", "Result": "**5. not guilty, because the defendant was unconscious.**\n\n**Explanation:**\n\nThis case hinges on the concept of strict liability and the defendant's state of mind.\n\n* **Strict Liability:** The statute is a strict liability crime, meaning the prosecution doesn't need to prove the defendant had any criminal intent (mens rea).  The act itself is enough for conviction.\n\n* **Unconsciousness:** However, the defendant was unconscious at the time of the sale.  This raises a key question: can a person be held criminally liable for an act they were incapable of controlling due to being unconscious?  \n\nGenerally, the answer is no.  Unconsciousness negates the required mens rea for most crimes, even strict liability offenses.

Conviction reversed, because a store owner is exempt from the statute, which applies only to consumers who use food stamps illegally. 2. Conviction affirmed, because the statute does not require the government to prove that the defendant knew his actions were in violation of the law. 3. Conviction affirmed, because the meaning of knowingly does not connote that there must be specific knowledge by the actor that what he is doing is illegal. 4. Conviction reversed, because the statute does not clearly define 'knowingly' and thus is too vague to enforce. 5. Conviction affirmed, because the modern trend of the law is to recognize criminal liability without mens rea or specific criminal intent. 6. Conviction reversed, because the law is unfairly biased against store owners who might unknowingly purchase discounted food stamps. 7. Conviction affirmed, because the statute only requires proof of intent to commit the act, not intent to violate the law. 8. Conviction reversed, because the better interpretation is that mens rea is included, and the owner must know his conduct is in violation of the criminal laws. 9. Conviction reversed, because the government failed to prove the store owner was aware that his actions were illegal. Answer:\n", "Result": "The correct answer is **3.

Although a number of lawyers applied for the position, one of the applicants submitted a particularly impressive resume. The dean of faculty for the law school immediately wrote to the applicant to offer him the position. In the letter, the dean offered to employ the applicant for the upcoming academic year, which started on August 15, at a salary of $75,000. The letter also listed the employment terms and conditions, one of which stated that professors are entitled to five paid sick days during the year. The dean included a detailed employment contract containing all these terms, for the applicant's signature. After the applicant received this letter, he replied by mail, requesting a salary of $85,000 and sick leave of 10 days. Upon receipt of the applicant's letter, the dean telephoned the applicant and told him that the law school followed the American Bar Association guidelines with respect to salary and sick leave for its professors. The applicant acquiesced on the salary question, but insisted that his sick leave be extended to 10 days. The dean replied, \"Let's not permit a minor issue to stand in the way of your coming to teach at our law school. In the event you require more than 5 sick days, I promise that the matter will be taken care of to your benefit. \" The applicant informed the dean that he would sign the contract and forward it to the dean, which he promptly did.

The man's birth certificate shows that he was born out of wedlock. The record of a proceeding for a support order shows that the businessman was adjudged to be father of the man. However, the man can establish his status as heir of the businessman only if he was legitimated by the marriage of his mother and the businessman subsequent to his birth. Thus, the man must prove that this marriage occurred. The man's attorney has not been able to discover any marriage license or certificate.

The president buys the three parcels from the farmer and begins formulating plans for constructing single-family dwelling units on the land. The original deed between the farmer and the development company contains a provision expressly binding \"upon all subsequent grantees, their heirs, and assigns,\" stipulating that any further subdivisions by any such persons shall be restricted to minimum two-acre lots to be used for single- family dwelling units only. The development company immediately subdivided two of the parcels into lots of three, four, and five acres, and began construction of homes thereon.

The parties negotiated a written distribution agreement, which stated that any order for windows placed by the retailer would be binding on the distributor \"only when expressly accepted by the distributor.\" For the next two years, the retailer forwarded orders to the distributor, and the distributor always filled the orders. In the third year, the distributor accused the retailer of overcharging customers to install the distributor's windows. The retailer responded that the distributor had no control over the retailer's installation prices. When the distributor received the retailer's next order for windows, it refused to fill the order. If the retailer sues the distributor for breach of contract, will it be likely to prevail? Choices: 1. Yes, because the parties' course of dealing binds the distributor to fill the retailer's order. 2. No, because the agreement gave the distributor the right to expressly accept or reject orders. 3. Yes, because the distributor has always filled the orders in the past, creating an expectation of continued performance. 4. No, because the retailer's practice of overcharging customers excused the distributor's refusal to fill the order. 5. Yes, because the distributor cannot arbitrarily decide not to fill the retailer's orders. 6. Yes, because the distributor's claim regarding overcharging customers is independent of its obligation to fill the retailer's order. 7. No, because the retailer's forwarding of orders to the distributor did not give rise to an obligation on the distributor's part to fill the orders. 8. No, because the distributor has the right to refuse orders at any time according to the agreement. 9.

While the woman was away on a vacation, there was a burglary at her home, and her favorite painting was stolen. Although the painting was insured for $1,000,000 by an insurance company, it had a market value of over $1,500,000. When the woman returned from vacation, she met with a detective employed by the insurance company to investigate the theft. During their meeting, the woman told the detective that she would pay him an extra $50,000 if he recovered the paihting. For the next three weeks, the detective investigated the theft as part of his job responsibilities with the insurance company. Within the course of this investigation, the detective learned who was responsible for the burglary. As a consequence, the culprit was apprehended, and the painting was recovered and returned to the woman. The detective then requested the $50,000 that the woman had promised to pay him. After the woman refused to make the payment, the detective sued the woman for breach of contract. Who is most likely to prevail? Choices: 1. The detective, because the market value of the painting exceeded its insured value, so there was sufficient consideration to support the woman's promise. 2. The woman, because her promise was gratuitous. 3. The woman, because the detective was already paid by the insurance company for his investigative services. 4. The detective, because he went above and beyond his job duties to recover the painting. 5. The woman, because she did not put the promise of extra payment in writing. 6.

Believing that the defendant was responsible for this killing, federal agents decided to plant an informant at the prison to befriend the defendant and possibly obtain evidence about the crime. In accord with this plan, the federal agents hired a paid informant and placed him in the prison as a fellow inmate, masquerading as an organized crime figure.

The informant then raised the subject in several conversations, but the defendant repeatedly denied any such involvement. After the defendant started receiving tough treatment from other inmates because of the rumor, the informant offered to protect the defendant but told him, \"You have to tell me the truth about what really happened you know, if you want me to help you. \" Believing that the informant would protect him from the other inmates, the defendant then admitted to the informant that he had driven his stepdaughter to the desert where he killed her.

The rental agreement provided that the land was to be used as farmland. Shortly after the tenant took possession of the tract of land, he built thereon, at his own expense, a barn made of lumber, which was 15 feet wide, 20 feet long, and set on loose bricks. The barn increased the appraised market value of the tract of land from $250,000 to $275,000. The tenant then began farming operations on the land. Toward the end of the lease period, the owner informed the tenant that he was going to put the tract of land up for sale. The next month, when the lease expired, the parties settled a dispute over the tenant's right, if any, to compensation for the improvements by the following written agreement:\"On the sale of the tract of land, the owner hereby agrees to pay the tenant two-thirds of any sale proceeds in excess of $250,000, provided that tenant may remain on the farm for the next year, rent-free, while the owner tries to sell it. After that time, the tenant may remain on the land until closing of the sale, at a monthly rental of $1,000. \"The owner initially set the asking price at $300,000. After receiving scant interest, the owner decided to reduce the price to $260,000. This price reduction so infuriated the tenant that he thereafter made negative comments about the farm to all of the prospective buyers. Finally, 14 months after the agreement between the owner and the tenant was executed, and after rejecting offers for $240,000 and $250,000, the owner sold the tract of land for $256,000 to a buyer who visited the land while the tenant was away on vacation. Thereupon, the tenant, who had failed to pay the last two months rent as per the agreement, moved out. After closing, the owner refused to pay the tenant any of the sale proceeds, and the tenant brought suit to recover damages for breach of contract. Which of the following is the owner's most persuasive argument in defense of the tenant's suit? Choices: 1. The tenant committed an uncured material breach of an implied promise to cooperate in the owner's efforts to sell the property, or at least not to hinder the proposed sale. 2. The owner's decision to reduce the asking price without consulting the tenant was a breach of their agreement. 3. The agreement between the owner and the tenant was voidable because it was a restraint on alienation, since it conditioned a promise to pay for a conveyance of land upon an otherwise invalid leasehold contract. 4. The tenant failed to maintain the property in a presentable state for potential buyers, thereby breaching his responsibilities under the agreement. 5. The tenant's failure to pay any rent for the last two months was a material breach of contract that discharged the owner's remaining duties of performance. 6.

The woman's sister owns parcel \"C,\" which lies the lowest on the mountain. Parcel \"B\" lies between Parcels \"A\" andIn 2000, the woman who originally owned all three parcels of land constructed a private drainage system. This system consisted of an underground pipeline that extended across all three parcels of land. Sewage from parcel \"A\" drained through the system to a municipal sewer, which was located at the bottom of the mountain. In 2005, the sister purchased parcel \"C\" from the woman. The deed to the sister did not contain any mention of the woman's drainage system. Located on each of the parcels are large ranch-style homes occupied by the respective owners. A portion of the sister's unimproved land began to subside over the drainage system. This was because of an especially pliable soil condition of which the woman was unaware prior to construction of the drainage system. In an action brought by the sister against the woman to recover property damage for the subsidence of her land, judgment should be for whom? Choices: 1. The woman, unless it can be proven that she intentionally hid the condition of the soil. 2. The woman, because the sister did not maintain the drainage system on her property. 3.

As a matter of constitutional law, which of the following results in this suit is most appropriate? Choices: 1. Judgment for the state, because the state has articulated a rational basis for this classification and, therefore, a court may not substitute its judgment for that of responsible state officials. 2. Judgment for the woman, because gender-based discrimination in state employment violates the Equal Protection Clause. 3. Judgment for the state, because it is within a state's police power to insulate the terms and conditions of governmental employment. 4. Judgment for the state, because the dangerous nature of the work in the narcotics division provides a valid basis for the policy. 5. Judgment for the woman, because the facts asserted do not demonstrate that the particular classification contained in this policy is substantially related to the advancement of an important state interest. 6. Judgment for the woman, because the terms and conditions of state government employment are privileges or immunities of state citizenship that may not be abridged by the state on the basis of gender. 7. Judgment for the woman, because the state's policy is not narrowly tailored to serve a compelling state interest. 8. Judgment for the state, because the nature of the position justifies a gender-based classification. 9.

Judgment for the woman, because the facts asserted do not demonstrate that the particular classification contained in this policy is substantially related to the advancement of an important state interest.**\n\nHere's why:\n\n* **Equal Protection Clause:** The Fourteenth Amendment's Equal Protection Clause prohibits states from denying any person within their jurisdiction the equal protection of the laws. This means that states cannot discriminate against individuals based on protected characteristics like gender.\n\n* **Rational Basis Review:**  Generally, when a law involves a classification based on gender, courts apply a \"rational basis\" review. This means the government must show that the law is rationally related to a legitimate government interest.\n\n* **Substantially Related:**  However, in cases involving gender classifications, the Supreme Court has held that the government must demonstrate that the classification is \"substantially related\" to an \"important\" government interest.

At trial, the prosecution attempted to present the testimony of the victim's out-of-state sister regarding a telephone conversation she had with the defendant. She had called their landline number to talk with her sister on the same day when he had first reported to the police that his fianc\u00c3\u00a9 had been missing for five days. The sister had not met the man but had spoken with him briefly a few other times. He told her that her sister \"went out all night last night and did not return yet.\" The prosecution attempted at trial to have the sister testify to the conversation to show the significant discrepancy between his stories to the police and to her. The defense objected, arguing that she couldn't authenticate the conversation because she couldn't identify the speaker as the defendant nor had she ever met him. The prosecution told the court that she felt it was \"probably\" his voice, which she recollected from the prior talks at the same number. Will the court likely grant the defendant's objection to the testimony? Choices: 1. Yes, because the conversation is hearsay and there are no exceptions that would allow it into evidence. 2. Yes, because the sister does not have sufficient experience and knowledge to be able to identify the man's voice and to say that the voice and the defendant were the same person. 3.

In need of cash, the nephew decided to sell the parcel. He contacted a real estate agent in the area about listing the parcel for sale. The nephew and the agent entered into a valid written contract whereby the agent promised to undertake best efforts to find a buyer for the parcel. The contract also provided that the agent was to be paid a commission of 5 percent on the gross sale price following the consummation of the sale and transfer of title. The agent succeeded in finding a buyer for the parcel. The agent notified the nephew that he had found a developer who wanted to purchase the parcel for $500,000. The agent handed the nephew a real estate sales contract, signed by the developer, in which the developer agreed to pay $500,000 for the purchase of the parcel. The nephew then signed the agreement himself. However, before consummation of the sale and transfer of title, the developer, without cause, repudiated the contract.

The loan was secured by a mortgage on the home. The bank promptly recorded the mortgage, which was the only lien on the home at that time. Several months later, the man borrowed $40,000 from his mother in order to purchase a new truck and gave his mother a mortgage on the home to secure repayment of the debt. The mother promptly recorded the mortgage. The man later lost his job and was struggling to make loan payments to both the bank and his mother. To accommodate the man's financial situation, the bank extended the amortization period of its loan to substantially reduce the amount of each monthly payment. The bank did not alter the interest rate or increase the principal amount of the loan. At the time of the modification of the bank loan, the man was not in default in his payments to his mother. Neither the bank nor the man informed the mother of the modification of the bank loan. After the man later missed five payments to his mother, she commenced a foreclosure action.

The attorney told the husband that his new state did not give full faith and credit to divorce proceedings in his former state of residence.

The pharmacist established and operated a drugstore at the leased premises. The leaseincluded provisions that described the shopping center by metes and bounds; identified the entrances, parkingareas, signs, and other common facilities of the shopping center; and set out a covenant that the owner wouldnot lease any part of the shopping center to another drugstore. Last year the owner purchased a parcel of land immediately adjacent to the shopping center. That parcel wasimproved with a building that, at the time of the owner's purchase and for ten years earlier, was occupied inpart by a food supermarket and in part by a discount drugstore, under leases which the prior owner assignedto the owner. The owner reconstructed the common facilities of both shopping centers to integrate them and combine themso that, to the public, the two centers appeared as a larger single development. The pharmacist learned that the lease of the discount drugstore was about to expire and that the ownerplanned to enter into a new lease of the same space with the discount drugstore.

In order to facilitate the access to the cottage, the chef entered into an agreement with a neighbor, an adjoining land owner, whereby the neighbor, in writing, granted the chef a right-of-way over a strip of land 30 feet in width and a quarter of a mile in length along the eastern margin of the neighbor's property. Without notifying the neighbor, the chef proceeded to improve the roadbed by having the road asphalted in order to make it more accessible for motor vehicle traffic. Several years later, the neighbor started a sand business, which required him to do heavy hauling that subsequently destroyed the asphalted surface on the road. Ten years after the neighbor started his sand business, the chef sold his lakefront property to his assistant. Shortly after the assistant took possession of the cottage and property, the neighbor erected wooden barriers across the roadway, thus obstructing the access to the assistant's property. The assistant's strongest argument in an action against the neighbor for removal of the barriers, which are obstructing his access to the property, would be that Choices: 1. the neighbor's sand business constitutes a misuse of the easement. 2. the chef's improvements to the roadbed grant him additional rights to the easement. 3. the chef and the assistant, being in privity of estate, could \"tack on\" their successive use periods. 4. an easement appurtenant is alienable in that any conveyance transferring possession of the dominant tenement also passes the easement privilege. 5. the assistant, as a bonafide purchaser, is protected from the neighbor's obstruction, even though the easement was unrecorded. 6. because the easement was created by implication, the chef's prior and continuous use gave rise to a prescriptive easement. 7. the assistant has a legal right to improve the easement for his own use. 8. the assistant is entitled to compensation for the damage caused by the neighbor's sand business. 9. the assistant can claim ownership of the easement due to his long-term use of the property.

A boy and a girl, both 12-year-old youngsters at the bonanza, were looking at each other's cards when they were approached by a 32-year-old collector. The collector asked the boy and girl if he could look through their baseball cards. The boy and girl nodded affirmatively. As the collector was flipping through the boy's cards, he found a 1948 card featuring Branch Rickey, the former owner of the Brooklyn Dodgers. The collector, who knew the card was worth more than $500, offered the boy 50 cents for the card.

The buyer told the owner that she was very interested in buying the business, but that she needed to get a loan from the bank to finance the purchase. The parties drafted a contract, signed by both parties, which stated that the buyer agreed to purchase the retail business from the owner for $250,000.

Trying to avoid the motorist, the driver veered his car onto the sidewalk. The car landed in a deep hole in the sidewalk. This hole had been dug by a construction company, which had been repairing a water main break earlier in the day. The construction company had been hired by the local municipal water department. Although the' construction company had erected a warning sign advising pedestrians about the hole, there was no fence or barrier surrounding it. When the driver's car fell into the hole, it ruptured the water main, engulfing the car with water.

Shortly thereafter, the developer prepared a subdivision plan that created 100 one-acre residential building lots on this tract. In 1997, the subdivision plan was recorded with the county recorder's office. During the next few years, the developer sold 60 residential lots to individual purchasers. Each deed specified that every lot designated on the subdivision plan was to be recorded in the county recorder's office. Each deed also provided the following:\"No house trailer or mobile home shall be built or maintained on any lot within the subdivision. \"In 2003, the developer conveyed the remaining 40 lots to a builder by deed that included language identical to that contained in the first 60 deeds. This deed from the developer to the builder was recorded. By 2008, the builder had sold all of the 40 lots. Each of these deeds identified each lot as being a part of the subdivision, but did not include the clause relating to mobile homes.

Corry is a computer hacker, who shut down the New York government's website by infecting it with a virus. The virus entered the electronic mail of users and mailed itself to every address listed in each user's e-mail address book every two hours. The website was crippled for the last week of January. The state passed a law in February clarifying that knowingly infecting the state's internet server with a computer virus met the definition of interference in the statute.

During their stay at Yellowstone, the family camped out in a secluded area of the campgrounds surrounded by tall pine trees. Numerous signs had been posted throughout the campgrounds warning campers of the extremely dry conditions prevailing in the forest area due to a summerlong drought. On the morning of their departure, the family cooked breakfast over an open campfire. After breakfast, the family began to pack their gear into the van when the father instructed his 12-year-old son to put out the campfire. The son fetched two pails of water from a nearby pond and tossed the water over the campfire. Believing that he had extinguished the fire, the son joined his family in the van, and they drove away. Unbeknownst to the son and his family, the campfire was still smoldering when they left. Shortly thereafter, a wind gust blew the flames from the fire to some nearby brush. Due to the extremely dry conditions, the brush quickly ignited, starting a raging forest fire. The forest rangers dispatched a firefighting team, which included two helicopters equipped to fight the fire. While these helicopters were fighting the blaze from above, the smoke \u0080\u00a2 surrounding one of the helicopters became so intense that the pilot lost all visibility.

Located below the ranch is an estate that is owned by a millionaire. A stream is a non-navigable watercourse that originates at the top of the mountain and runs all the way down into a valley. Both the ranch and the estate are within the watershed of the stream. When the millionaire purchased the estate in 1956, he started taking water from the stream and used it to irrigate the southern half of his property, which he has used as a farm. Prior to 1956, the southern half of the estate had been cleared and placed in cultivation, while the northern half remained wooded and virtually unused. The millionaire continued this established pattern of use and has never stopped using the water in this way. In 1986, the rancher built a home on the ranch and started talcing water from the stream for domestic purposes. During that year there was heavy rainfall, and this caused the stream to run down the mountain at a high water level. However, in 1987, a drought caused the stream to flow at a very low level. Consequently, there was only enough water to irrigate the millionaire's farmland or, in the alternative, to supply all of the rancher's domestic water needs and one-quarter of the millionaire's irrigation requirements. The mountain is located in a jurisdiction where the period of prescription is 15 years. The rancher is continuing to take water for his personal needs and there is insufficient water to irrigate the estate. The millionaire then brings an appropriate action in 1996 to declare that his water rights to the stream are superior to those of the rancher.

The rancher executed such a deed, and the fanner promptly recorded it. The farmer's intent was to acquire color of title and obtain ownership of the orange grove by adverse possession. In 1998, the farmer constructed a fence around the orange grove. In 1999, the son presented his deed of the orange grove to a retiree, and for $15,000, paid by the retiree, signed and delivered a deed of the orange grove in favor of the retiree and his heirs.

Apparently, the co-defendants' investments had not been performing well in the economic downturn. The co-defendants, upset and humiliated by their firing, vowed to get back at the bank. As their revenge, they decided to plant a bomb in the bank and demand $2,000,000. After receiving the money, they would then reveal the location of the bomb and provide details for defusing it. The co-defendants agreed that the bank should be given adequate warning so that nobody would be injured. In accordance with their plan, the co-defendants consulted the Internet, where they found all the information they needed on how to build a bomb. They built the bomb and placed it in a supply closet. Shortly thereafter, they phoned the bank and made a demand for the money. They said a bomb was in the bank and that it would explode in 24 hours unless the money was paid.

Hundreds of tourists poured into the area to work on the large block of ice. They made a gigantic ice palace for a variety of Disney princesses. To handle the needs of a great number of tourists, food vendors came from all over and set up their carts. To solve the problem of congestion, safety, and insufficient security, the town passed an ordinance restricting all street vendors to a specified parking lot area. The food vendors and others were losing money under the regulation. Would a commerce clause challenge to the parking lot requirement be successful by the food stand owners? Choices: 1. No, because the regulation does not discriminate against out-of-state interests and the local benefits outweigh the burdens on commerce. 2. Yes, because the ordinance is an unconstitutional interference with the free flow of commerce among the states. 3.

After the homeowner's funeral, the uncle returned to his own residence, but the best friend decided to occupy the estate. He put his name on the mailbox and has paid the taxes and maintenance expenses. To earn extra money, the best friend rented a small house on the property to a teacher and received a monthly rental payment from her. The best friend also grew fruits on the property and sold them at a stand on Fridays. The uncle has been generally aware of this, but because he cared little about the estate, the uncle has never pressed the best friend about the property. Since 1985 the uncle has not paid any rent or other compensation to the best friend, nor has the best friend requested such payment. In January 2010, a series of disputes arose between the uncle and the best friend for the first time concerning their respective rights to the estate. The state in which the property is located recognizes the usual common law types of cotenancies and follows majority rules on rents and profits. There is no applicable legislation on the subject.

Will the court uphold the liquidated damages clause in favor of the city? Choices: 1. No, because the city has not suffered any loss due to the delay as there was no traffic flow. 2. Yes, because the contractor failed to deliver on the agreed timeline, regardless of whether the city had connected a road or not. 3. Yes, because the contract provision for liquidated damages has been breached and the city had no obligation to connect a road. 4. No, because the city breached the contract by not connecting a road to the bridge. 5. Yes, because the bridge delays caused the city to delay finishing the road, thereby creating the need to enforce the provision for liquidated damages. 6. No, because the liquidated damages clause is only enforceable if there are actual damages, which there are not in this case. 7. Yes, because the liquidated damages clause serves to penalize the contractor for the delay, regardless of the city's actions. 8.

Her garden had become a showplace for the neighborhood, and various civic groups and organizations frequently visited the woman's property to enjoy the beauty of the yard. Recently, the woman had read about a particular cymbidium that was native to Japan. Desiring to have one of these cymbidiums planted in her garden, she contacted a number of plant distributors, only to discover that this particular cymbidium had not yet been imported to the United States. She contacted a plant distributor, who she knew had ties to Japan, and asked if it would be possible to acquire one of these cymbidiums from Japan. After checking with local and Japanese authorities, the distributor determined that he could indeed acquire the plant for the woman. The parties then signed a contract that stated the distributor would acquire the cymbidium from a nursery in Japan, have it shipped to the United States and have it planted in the woman's garden for the price of $5,000. The distributor promised that the plant would be in place within six months, and the woman promised to pay $1,000 at the time of the execution of the contract and$4,000 when the cymbidium was planted in her garden. The woman then handed a check for $1,000 to the distributor. Two weeks later, agricultural officials discovered that a special type of beetle that attacked citrus plants had adapted to using cymbidiums for nesting purposes. The female beetle would lay eggs among the roots of the cymbidiums, and it would sometimes take up to one year for the eggs to hatch. Fearing for the safety of the citrus crops in the United States, the United States government adopted a ban on the importation of all cymbidiums grown in foreign countries. As a result, the distributor was not able to acquire the cymbidium for the woman. Which of the following best states the legal relationship at this point between the distributor the woman? Choices: 1. The distributor's performance was not excused because of impossibility, and the woman can recover damages. 2.

However, at the prosecution's request, the court impaneled a jury. The defendant was subsequently convicted by the jury and sentenced to six months imprisonment.

It is the circus's practice to finish each day's entertainment by discharging a so-called aerial bomb into the sky. After exploding, the aerial bomb emits a spectacular rainbow fireworks display that is seen for miles around. One afternoon, a 10-year-old boy and a few friends went to the fairgrounds to see the circus. After paying their admission, they were about to enter the \"big top\" when the boy came upon an aerial bomb lying on the ground. Ignorant of what the object really was, but in an exploratory mood, the boy applied a match to the fuse of the fireworks device. It exploded and seriously injured the boy. After the accident, and before the parents of the boy had retained a lawyer, the adjuster for the circus's insurance carrier contacted the parents several times, trying to negotiate a settlement of their claim against the circus. On each occasion, the adjuster told the parents there was no need for them to hire an attorney because the applicable civil code did not provide for recovery in such a situation. The adjuster was aware that this information was blatantly false. He also warned the parents that unless they accepted his offered settlement of $5,000, they would receive nothing. For over a month, the adjuster continued to harass the parents. Outraged by the adjuster's actions, the parents sought the advice of a neighbor who recommended that they consult an attorney. The parents went ahead and retained a lawyer who subsequently negotiated a $250,000 settlement with the adjuster's insurance company for the claims relating to the boy's injury from the aerial bomb.

After doing a thorough inspection of the car, the mechanic told the woman that her car needed extensive work and that he could do all that was needed for $1,000. The parties then entered into a written contract to have the car serviced for $1,000. As the woman remembers it, at the time the written contract was formed, the parties orally agreed that if the car required any additional servicing above that detailed in the contract, it would be included in the $1,000 fee. The mechanic, however, has no recollection of any such oral agreement. While servicing the car, the mechanic discovered that a belt was severel' worn and need to be replaced. The belt replacement was not listed as work to be performed in the written contract. The mechanic telephoned the woman and told her he had found the worn belt and felt he should replace it. The woman told him to do so. When the mechanic was finished, he presented the woman with a bill for $1,100, representing the $1,000 called for by the contract and $100 for the replacement of the worn belt, which is a reasonable amount. The woman refused to pay any more than$1,000. The mechanic sued the woman to collect the $100 for the replacement of the worn belt.

The company provided security protection to the owner's property for two years. The owner then notified the company that he was planning to sell the cottage. As a result, he requested that the company discontinue its home-protection service, effective immediately. Two weeks later, a burglar broke into the cottage and was ransacking it. As the burglar was exiting from the owner's house carrying a portable television set, he was seen by a security guard working for the company. The security guard, who was driving past the home on security patrol, had not been informed that the owner had discontinued protection services. The security guard suddenly stopped his patrol vehicle and ran toward the burglar shouting, \"Stop! Don't move or I'll shoot!\" Startled, the burglar dropped the television set and began to flee.

Before the passage of the law, approximately 28% of all ink cartridges used in the state was packaged in plastic bags. Of that total, 75% of the ink cartridges was packaged outside the state, while 25% was packaged by companies in-state. The legislature passed the bill at the strong urging of the paper industry.

Assume that the state Supreme Court adjudges the law to be unconstitutional on the grounds that it violates the contracts clauses of both the federal and the state Constitutions. The contracts clause of the state Constitution is similar to the one in the federal Constitution.

A note was attached indicating that the woman was being fined for smoking during business hours. Although the woman protested, the restaurant refused to make any waiver and stood by its policy. In an action by the woman against the restaurant to recover the $50, which of the following is the best argument in the woman's favor? Choices: 1. The woman was not given a warning before the fine was implemented, which goes against standard disciplinary procedures. 2. The woman was not properly informed of the nonsmoking policy upon her hire, rendering the fine invalid. 3. The nonsmoking provision concerning disciplinary action is unenforceable, because it attempts to impose a penalty instead of reasonably liquidating the damages, if any, sustained by the restaurant. 4. The restaurant's nonsmoking policy violates the woman's right to smoke, which is protected under the law. 5. The nonsmoking provision is discriminatory as it does not take into account the personal habits or needs of the employees. 6. The restaurant violated the woman's rights by imposing a fine without giving her a chance to defend herself. 7. The restaurant impliedly waived the nonsmoking provision by permitting the woman to continue working for the rest of the day. 8.

In this case, the restaurant's nonsmoking policy could be seen as a constructive condition subsequent to the woman's employment.\n\n* **Temporary Impracticability:**  The woman's actions were directly caused by an extraordinary and unforeseen event (the armed robbery).

In the event that the furniture store brings suit against its employee (the truck driver) to recover for its losses, the furniture store will recover Choices: 1. $15,000, because the employee and the furniture store share 60-40 responsibility for the accident. 2. $25,000, unless the furniture store was fully insured against such losses. 3. nothing, because the furniture store should have maintained the truck in a safer condition. 4. $25,000, because the employee was at fault in causing the accident. 5. nothing, because the furniture store was primarily liable for the entire amount of damages. 6. $12,500, unless the furniture store had provided proper training to the employee. 7. nothing, because the employee was not acting negligently. 8. the full amount, only if the employee has sufficient personal insurance coverage. 9. $12,500, because the employer and employee bear equal shares of responsibility for the plaintiff's injuries. 10. nothing, because the employee was acting within the scope of his employment.

This makes the employee liable for the damages.\n\n* **Scope of Employment:** The employee was acting within the scope of their employment when they were driving the truck to deliver furniture. This means the furniture store could be held vicariously liable for the employee's actions.\n\n* **Insurance Coverage:**  The key factor is whether the employee has sufficient personal insurance coverage to cover the $25,000 judgment.  \n\n    * **If the employee has insurance:** The furniture store can likely recover the full $25,0", "MaxTokenProbability": "8", "Perplexity": 7.06, "GroundTruth": "4. $25,000, because the employee was at fault in causing the accident."}, {"Index": 888, "Instance": "Topic: law\nQuestion: [question] Choices: [choices] Answer: [answer]\nQuestion: In 1985, a widow, the undisputed owner of a cottage, leased it to a tenant for a term of seven years.

The son had never warned the grandfather to look out for toys. The grandfather brought an action against his son to recover for his injuries.

The jurisdiction has abolished intra-family immunity and applies the traditional rules of landowner liability. What action should the court take? Choices: 1.

The landlord never objected to this assignment. Six months after the assignment, the landlord conveyed his property interest in the premises to a new owner. After residing in the house for a year, the professor subleased the third floor to a student for a term of two years; the agreement provided that the professor would receive a monthly rental payment of $100. After the student had made regular rental payments to the professor for the first six months of the sublease, he defaulted. The following month, the professor sent the new owner $200 as payment for rent and notified him that he should collect the remaining $100 from the student, who refused to vacate the premises.

There has been considerable concern among state health officials who foresee that many of the senior citizens will become victims of price gouging on certain medical supplies and services. In an attempt to curb such fraudulent sales practices, the state legislature has enacted a law prohibiting the sale of hearing aids by non-physicians. The measure provides, however, that all non-physician sellers who are presently engaged in the business of selling hearing aids will not be affected. Assume that after the statute goes into effect, a non-physician moves to the state and wants to open a business selling hearing aids. After being advised that the state law prohibits him from doing so, he brings suit challenging the constitutionality of the statute. The most likely result is that the state law will be declared Choices: 1. unconstitutional, because it violates the commerce clause, since Congress has plenary power to regulate any activity that has any appreciable effect on interstate commerce. 2. unconstitutional, because it creates an unfair trade barrier for non-physicians wanting to start a business in the state. 3. constitutional, as it aims to protect a vulnerable segment of the population from potential exploitation. 4. constitutional, because there is a rational basis for distinguishing between non-physicians are not so engaged. 5. unconstitutional, because it discriminates between non-physicians already in the business and those wanting to enter it. 6. unconstitutional, because it restricts the rights of non-physicians to conduct a legitimate business. 7. constitutional, because it falls under the state's power to regulate healthcare and related services. 8. constitutional, because it does not infringe upon the rights of non-physicians not already in the business of selling hearing aids. 9. constitutional, because a state has the power to regulate any phase of local business, even though such regulations may have some effect on interstate commerce, provided that Congress has not enacted legislation regarding the subject matter.

The ski lift company had installed and operated the lift pursuant to a concession agreement with the owner of the private park. Visitors gained entry to the park on payment of a $5 fee, which entitled them to go ice skating, tobogganing, or sledding. A ski lift ticket cost an additional $7 per day. At the top of the ski lift, there was a platform for embarking and disembarking passengers. The ski lift company paid the owner a stipulated rental plus 15 percent of the net proceeds from the lift. Two employees of the company operated the lift, one from a station at the bottom and the other from a station at the top of the hill. When the vacationer boarded the ski lift, it was late afternoon and most of the skiers had left. He was the sole passenger on the lift. Meanwhile, the employee at the top had left his post to go to the bathroom, asking his friend to keep watch on the lift and to stop it to allow any passengers to disembark. The friend consented, and the employee showed him how to use the control switch. When the vacationer approached the top, the employee was still away. Instead of stopping the lift to permit the vacationer to get off, the friend allowed the lift to keep moving. The vacationer was carried past the platform, and he was swung violently from side to side as the ski lift started downward. When the employee returned and sized up the situation, he threw the switch, stopping the lift.

As the man approached a railroad crossing he noticed that the barriers to the crossing were open. The man cautiously looked both ways for any train. Assuming that no train was coming, he proceeded across the railroad tracks. Suddenly, an oncoming train struck the man's car, completely demolishing it. The man was dead on arrival at the local hospital. Unknown to the man, the railroad crossing guard, in a drunken stupor, had fallen asleep at the barrier controls. He failed to see or hear the signals from the oncoming train that struck and killed the man. The railroad company was well aware of the crossing guard's alcoholism, but continued to employ him. However, two weeks after the accident occurred, the railroad company fired the crossing guard. The executor of the man's estate institutes a wrongful death action against the railroad company. During the trial, the attorney for the man's estate offered into proof the fact that the defendant railroad company dismissed the crossing guard shortly after the accident. Upon objection by the railroad company's attorney, the court should Choices: 1. overrule the objection, as the employee's dismissal was an admission that the railroad company was aware of the crossing guard's chronic alcoholism. 2. sustain the objection, as the dismissal is irrelevant to the case at hand. 3. sustain the objection, as evidence of subsequent remedial repairs is inadmissible. 4. overrule the objection, as the dismissal is direct evidence of negligence. 5. overrule the objection, as an adoptive admission by conduct. 6. overrule the objection, as the dismissal is evidence of the railroad company's knowledge of the guard's incompetence. 7. sustain the objection, as the dismissal could unduly influence the jury. 8. sustain the objection, because the probative value of the evidence would be outweighed by its prejudicial effect. 9. overrule the objection, as the dismissal is circumstantial evidence of negligence. 10. sustain the objection, as the dismissal could be seen as an admission of guilt.

The state's economy used to be based solely on heavy industry. However, the state legislature approved legalized gambling within the state. As a consequence, many casinos and new hotels were built and the state's economy boomed. These moves were often induced by the granting by the state of special tax benefits for the construction of new casinos and hotels under state statutes. Recently, however, neighboring states have legalized gambling and offered greater tax incentives to the gaming industry. As a result, many of the casino and hotel owners have begun to leave the state. The unemployment and social welfare benefits the state has had to pay have substantially increased, burdening the remaining casinos, and also making it difficult for the state to lower its taxes to remain competitive with other states. On account of this predicament, the state legislature passed, and the governor duly signed, an emergency bill into law. According to the statute, the state imposed a one cent tax on the playing of any slot machine in any gambling casino. Since virtually all the slot machines required a payment of either a dime, quarter, or dollar, the imposition of this tax required a major costly adaptation on each slot machine to allow for the deposit of the additional one cent tax. Although many casino owners have complained about the tax, their only alternative is to absorb the tax themselves and lose one cent per game. As a consequence of the tax, fewer slot machines are purchased in the state by the casino owners. No manufacturer of slot machines is located in the state.

In 2000, the railroad decided to discontinue operating its trains over the strip conveyed in 1955. By 2004, the growth of a nearby town had made the 300-acre cattle ranch valuable as a potential site for homes or for an industrial park. However, as of January 1, 2005, the governing body of the county (in which the ranch sits) took appropriate action, in accordance with Texas statutes, to zone the 300-acre cattle ranch as single-family residential property with a minimum lot size of one acre. The ordinance provided that the exclusion of ranching operations and industrial development was necessary to protect the health of county residents by limiting the extent of waste disposal and preventing pollution of air and the nearby river, the county's major water supply.

The grocery store was situated in the first floor of the building in which the husband and wife occupied a second-floor apartment. Late one evening, the defendant was walking past the grocery store when he decided to steal the money he heard had been stashed in a cigar box inside the store. The defendant furtively walked to the rear of the building. He then proceeded to open the gate to the fenced-in back yard. Once inside the back yard, the defendant attempted to pry open the back window of the grocery store. Awakened by the barking of his watchdog, the husband went out onto his second- floor back porch and saw the defendant below. The husband yelled at the defendant. Startled, the defendant turned to run when he noticed a large package lying outside the rear door to the store.

In her letter, the official explains that state election officials are of the opinion that it is necessary for potential voters to write the candidate's name in ink. Therefore, she concludes that the stickers do not comply with statutory requirements. Three weeks later, the candidate filed suit in federal district court against the election officials, claiming that their interpretation of the state statute violates the U. S. Constitution. Thereafter, one of the candidate's opponents filed suit in state court seeking to prevent state election officials from counting any write-in ballots with stickers.

The federal court should remand the case to the state court to decide the constitutional issue presented. 2. The federal court should hear the case and make a ruling before the state court. 3.

One of the contractors in turn sought bids from several subcontractors to determine the overall cost of the job. An electrician submitted a bid to do the electrical work to the contractor, which the contractor used in computing the bid he sent to the owner. The contractor notified the electrician to that effect. Two weeks later, the contractor submitted his bid to the owner, in which he offered to perform the renovation work for $75,000. The next day, the electrician notified the contractor that he was unable to perform the electrical work on the owner's project. Two days later, the owner sent the contractor a signed confirmation letter wherein she stated, \"I hereby accept your offer to perform the renovation work for the quoted cost of $75,000. \"Thereafter, the contractor hired another electrician to complete the electrical work at a cost of $5,000 above the first electrician's bid. The contractor explained the situation to the owner and informed her that the overall cost of the job would have to be increased to $80,000. The owner responded that she would hold the contractor to his original bid of $75,000 and would not be responsible for any additional costs.

The landscaper performed the work for four months but was then offered another job for $500 per month and, after notifying the homeowner, stopped doing the promised work and took the other job. The homeowner refused to pay the landscaper anything. The homeowner could have hired a comparable landscaper to complete the work for $300 per month.

Answer:\n", "Result": "The correct answer is **9. The landscaper will recover $1,200 for the work done before the breach.**\n\nHere's why:\n\n* **Breach of Contract:** The landscaper breached the contract by stopping work before the six months were up.\n* **Damages:** The homeowner is entitled to damages for the breach.  \n* **Mitigation of Damages:** The homeowner has a duty to mitigate damages, meaning they should take reasonable steps to minimize their losses. In this case, they could have hired another landscaper to finish the job.\n* **Calculation of Damages:** The homeowner's damages are the difference between the contract price and the cost of hiring a replacement. Since the contract price was $300 per month for six months ($1,800 total), and the homeowner could have hired someone for the same price, their damages are $1,800 - $1,200 = $600.\n\n*", "MaxTokenProbability": "1", "Perplexity": 4.65, "GroundTruth": "9.

A man was arrested and charged with the crime of drug addiction. Two officers testified that they examined \"track\" marks on the defendant's arms and wrists, and that he admitted to past drug usage. The accused testified that he was not an addict and the marks were from an allergic reaction. The trial court instructed the jury that it could find him guilty on proof that he was an addict, without proof of drug usage. The jury did not believe the defendant's denials, and found him guilty based on the observed track marks. The court sentenced him to six months imprisonment. He appealed, claiming cruel and unusual punishment prohibited by the Eighth and Fourteenth Amendments of the United States Constitution. Will the conviction likely be reversed on appeal? Choices: 1. Yes, because the statute makes it criminal to use illegal drugs, which constitutes cruel and unusual punishment. 2. No, because the arrest is based on the regular use of illegal narcotics and is a proper concern of the criminal law. 3. Yes, because the physical evidence is not enough to prove that the defendant is currently using drugs. 4. No, because the jury found him guilty based on the evidence presented in the trial. 5. Yes, because addiction is a medical condition and should be treated as such, not criminalized. 6. No, because the state has the power to forbid the use of narcotics within its borders and that's what this statute does. 7. Yes, because the statute punishes having the illness of drug addiction, which is like punishing someone for having a cold, and it is thus cruel and unusual punishment. 8.

However, the second friend accused the first friend of fouling because his foot went over the line. The first friend denied fouling and wanted to mark down a strike on the scorecard.

As the second friend turned his back, the first friend approached from behind with a bowling ball in his hand. The first friend then raised the bowling ball threatening to hit the back of the second friend's head. The second friend, who had his back turned, did not see the first friend's actions. The third friend saw what the first friend was about to do and could easily have warned the second friend; but the third friend remained silent.
