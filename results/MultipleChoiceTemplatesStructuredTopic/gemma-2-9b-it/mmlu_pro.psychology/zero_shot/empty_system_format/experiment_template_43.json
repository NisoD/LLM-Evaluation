Over the year, she has become fluent in social English. After a few months in a monolingual English second grade, her teacher refers her for evaluation because she has great difficulty with the basal reader used in the class. Two English proficiency tests administered to the student show that she performs above the mean for monolingual English grade peers in speaking and listening but well below the mean in reading and writing.

Decay Theory is supported if the recall is unaffected over time, while Interference Theory is supported if recall decreases with the introduction of a competing task shortly after learning. II.
